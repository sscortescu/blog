Hi there! Thanks for coming to my blog where I write about my entrepreneurial journey!

On Monday, I started the Antler program together with around 60 other founders. It‚Äôs amazing to see so many curious, driven people, that all want to build something great, all in one place. I‚Äôm very grateful to share this experience with them.

For the coming months, I‚Äôll be writing about my progress at Antler, where my goal is to find one or two co-founders, explore an idea together, and build it up to a seed-stage company.  

Before I jump in, a quick update on SquidGPT: last week I did a final push on this project, updating the landing page and submitting the app for review to the Slack Marketplace. Fingers crossed for a smooth approval

# üÖ∞Ô∏èAntler program process and first observations

Overall, the first week was very exciting but also quite intense. Next week will be even more intense, but then the scheduled programming gets a lot lighter and it‚Äôs on participants to self organize.

## The process so far

Antler has an interesting process for creating serendipity and inducing self-reflection. Roughly speaking, in the first two weeks there‚Äôs a full schedule, consisting of:

- **Networking**: speed networking and lunch roulette
- **Educative presentations**: AMAs with founders from previous cohorts, talks on how to match with cofounders, finding a good problem to solve, guided self-reflection
- **Small group projects**: Identifying personal skills and determining the split of responsibilities between founders, brainstorming and exploring topics of interest)

All these were super helpful to start honing in on the people I‚Äôd like to work with. It all starts with chemistry. I felt a very interesting boost in self awareness. From the first few interactions with a person, I can hear myself thinking whether I can work with them. 

If the answer is yes (about 50% of the time, I made a spreadsheet), the next step is to compare commitment, working style, values and skills. Commitment (e.g. runway, other responsibilities), working style (e.g. communication, conflict resolution), and values need to be compatible. Ideally, skills need to be different. 

As my skills are in strategy, operations and product, I‚Äôm searching for people strong in software engineers. Alternatively, if there‚Äôs really good chemistry and super-compatible values, style and interests I‚Äôd also be ok with more overlap in skills. 

There‚Äôs a [cool guide from 1st round](https://proof-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/firstround/50%20Questions%20for%20Co-Founders.pdf), that suggests a bunch of good topics to align on, when dating a cofounder.

## Some personal observations

Since the schedule is so packed, and the timeline is so tight, it does feels like a race. It‚Äôs interesting that it‚Äôs not a race against the other participants. On the contrary, people are super helpful. It‚Äôs a race against time. 

You have to be really honest with yourself and each other. This includes sharing weaknesses and answering less comfortable questions. 

That creates space for a lot of fun, and I already led me to some deep, connected conversations. I‚Äôm sure more are coming. These conversations are already valuable enough to return the investment of time into the program. 

Finally, this feels a bit like a reality tv show (hence the title of this post). I wonder if there could be a business in organizing a similar program for romantic dating.

# ****üóøPersonal update:¬†How‚Äôs it going, Stefan?****

Although the first week of the program was very intense, I feel energized. Also, I‚Äôm very happy to have already identified a few people that I think I could work with. 

Taking this weekend to recharge. If the weather‚Äôs good, I‚Äôd love to open the hiking season üåÑ. 

# ‚û°Ô∏èNext steps

The priority for next week is to start discussing compatibility with the people with whom the chemistry seems to be there.

Hi there! Thanks for coming to my blog where I write about my entrepreneurial journey! I‚Äôm writing this from a train going to Le Havre. Somehow it feels like I‚Äôm sending a postcard into the ether. 

This post*card* is the second in a series I will be writing while participating in the Antler program. The 1st post is [here](http://www.scortescu.com/posts/antler_w1/). 

The first week of Antler was intense, but the second week even more so. Almost every day, when the office would close, we‚Äôd go for dinner and drinks and more socializing. What‚Äôs awesome about this is that besides finding a team, there‚Äôs a lot of friendship potential. On the other hand, it must be draining for introverts. 

I spent less time in presentations and more time in group projects (team challenges). The project topics and teams were different every day, which helped test out waters with a few more people. With so little time to do something meaningful, the topics are really just an excuse to show your working style and way of thinking, and check the fit with other people.

However, the last project was quite exciting in itself - a hustle challenge. The goal was to get as much traction as possible in a 2-3 days. A company can show traction in different ways ranging from ‚Äúsure thing‚Äù (e.g. revenue) to ‚Äúbasically nothing‚Äù (e.g. statement of intent, waiting list signups). 

The feeling of working on this was quite unique. With our team, we decided to go for cash - more difficult but also more real. Our idea was to go door-to-door selling review QR codes to restaurants. With more than 80% of customers using Google Maps to find businesses, it‚Äôs shocking how many businesses still don‚Äôt ask their customers for reviews. We actually sold the one below, along with a few others. 

![qr](/antler_w2/qr.png#center)

Finally, the big achievement of the week is that I started discussing more seriously with two potential cofounders. We‚Äôre talking about our values, the skills and experience we bring to the table and what we could build together. With some teams already tracking out (Antler speak for getting engagedüíç), there‚Äôs some FOMO. 

It‚Äôs a fine line to walk between trying to form a team as soon as possible (also because others are doing it, so the supply of cofounders is shrinking), and taking the time you need to be sure you want to give it a try with someone. Tracking out is a formal process. It shows a higher level of commitment and that you discussed some compatibility basics. In exchange, Antler provides a higher level of support and access.---

Hi there! It‚Äôs been too long since my last post. The truth is that the Antler experience started taking more and more time and headspace, including on the weekends. I tried to use all of the down time to rest and recharge, but now weekly posts are back on. 

In this post I‚Äôll cover three things:

- **üÖ∞Ô∏èA quick summary of my Antler experience**
- **üóøPersonal update:¬†How‚Äôs it going, Stefan?**
- üß†**Next steps**

Let‚Äôs jump right in!

# üÖ∞Ô∏èAntler summary

While the first two weeks of the Antler program were full of scheduled programming (presentations, workshops, etc.), the weeks after were about short bursts of time trying to start projects with different people in the program. I officially formed a team (yes, Antler asks you to declare your team) three times, and tried forming one with 2-3 other people. 

![cohort](/antler_wrapup/cohort.jpg#center)

## 1st team: Medical coding

In the first team (week 4 of the program), we were trying to work on automating medical coding (transforming medical diagnoses and procedures into codes to facilitate communication & payment between doctors and insurers) with Artificial Intelligence. My cofounder is a Machine Learning superstar, and he had previously worked on medical coding automation. 

I got excited by the huge potential for transforming this industry, and encouraged by the fact that I could easily understand both the business and technical side of this project. Also, my cofounder had already made some progress both technically and in terms of business development.

However, as we started working on the project, we realized that we wanted to do things quite differently, both in communication and in execution. After two weeks, we decided to break it off, and try other things. 

## 2nd team: ???

With my second team we had a different approach to starting the project (week 7 of the program). We were three people in the team, and we had been discussing project ideas as duos since the start of the program. As we didn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúproblem-to-solve‚Äù, we began with a 3 day ideation, where we tried to brainstorm or copy problems and ideas that we are interested in. 

We learned quickly that we couldn‚Äôt all agree on an area or industry to tackle. Our common interests as duos didn‚Äôt translate to a clear overlap in the trio. Additionally, we had discovered that our different communication styles prevented us from making quick progress. I decided to track out (break up) and try again. 

## 3rd team: AI therapy chatbot

Week 8 was the last week of the program when we could officially form teams. Since time was running out, I decided to pursue the problem that interests me most - Mental Health. I shared this with the Antler cohort, which led to forming the team I‚Äôm in now. 

Two weeks was too short to make enough progress to stay in the Antler race (i.e. be allowed to participate in the investment committee). However, we decided to stay together after Antler, and keep working on the project. We're very excited about building the next generation of emotional support app. 

## Lessons learned

I didn‚Äôt end up getting the Antler funding within the 10 weeks of the program. However, looking back, I‚Äôm very happy to have been part of this experience. Here‚Äôs a few things I (re-)learned in these 2.5 months:

- **Fail even faster** - don‚Äôt be afraid to jump in and back out of things if the gut feeling is not right. However, once committed, give everything you can. Start from hypotheses and try to actively prove/disprove them.
- **Perception is reality** - fake it till you make it is real. Especially, when things are just getting started, conviction and trust is based on clear and confident communication of vision and potential.
- **Take all the feedback** - don‚Äôt discriminate who is giving the feedback, and try to get feedback from as many people as possible. Then use it. At least until you find a well-defined segment of users and supporters that really matter.
- **Increase your luck surface** - when things are ambiguous, it pays off to try a lot of things and talk to a lot of people. Also, it‚Äôs well worth it to be as helpful as possible whenever you have the chance.

That‚Äôs it for now, but I‚Äôll bring this section back in future posts.  

# **üóøPersonal update:¬†How‚Äôs it going, Stefan?**

Antler has been physically, emotionally and cognitively demanding. It made me push my limits, which is one of my core values. However, pushing boundaries like this doesn‚Äôt come for free. It was a sprint in the marathon called entrepreneurship. 

On top of that, while doing the program, I visited Macedonia for a week for a friend‚Äôs wedding (both the wedding and Macedonia were simply amazing). In Macedonia, I sprained my ankle, which could mean that I‚Äôll need to postpone my marathon plans. After that, my mom and grandma visited me in Paris. 

All this means I really needed some time for myself to recharge and find my way back to a healthy rhythm. I think I‚Äôm there now, and I‚Äôm really excited for the next phase.

# üß†Next steps

Antler is over, but I‚Äôm still working on the project I started before Antler ended. With my confounder (an amazing UX researcher and designer), we want to help solve the ongoing mental health epidemic. I will share more about the project next week, but here‚Äôs a teaser: [our brand new landing page](https://heyiro.com/).

title: "#1 Building in public and Generating startup ideas"
date: 2022-11-23
draft: false
---

Hi, I‚Äôm Stefan. 

If you‚Äôre reading this you probably know me personally, so you know that I‚Äôve had an entrepreneurial itch since the pandemic started. Two and a half years later, I‚Äôve built up enough courage to scratch that itch. I plan to spend the next phase of my life creating a software solution to a yet-to-be-defined problem. 

**What‚Äôs in this post:**

- **Building in public** - why I‚Äôll be sharing my progress step by step
- **Generating startup ideas -** how I‚Äôm approaching the first step in building a business

## üì¢Building in public

### What is building in public?

Building in public is about **periodically and publicly sharing the progress** of building a solution/product/company. It‚Äôs the **opposite of building in stealth**. 

The kind of stuff people share varies (see lists of examples [here](https://www.failory.com/blog/building-in-public) and [here](https://trends.vc/trends-0084-build-in-public/)). What I plan to share is:

- Learnings, insights and reflections on the solutions I‚Äôll be building and on the process to get there
- Achievements, milestones, results‚Ä¶ and failures
- Questions, struggles and ideas

### Why build in public?

Every good thing has three reasons to back it up (aka, what is this solving?):

1. **Accountability**: Working in an organization naturally gives you some structure: checking in with your boss, meeting deadlines, producing output that someone else needs as input. All this creates accountability that is missing when you go at it alone. Committing to share progress publicly is one way to create this kind of accountability, at least before customers 
2. **Clarify thinking:** Writing forces you to examine your thoughts from a distance. It‚Äôs easier to think about your thinking when you can read about it. When someone else might read these thoughts, the pressure is on to explain things clearly. (OK, bear with me, if this whole thing isn‚Äôt clear, I‚Äôm just starting üòÖ)
3. **Get feedback.** No need to explain this one. Please share your feedback. 

**Bonus reason**: One thing that helped me build up the courage to start something is reading about what & how others are building. Hopefully, what I write will pass some inspirations and learnings up the karma chain. Sharing is caring üíì.  

### My approach to building in public

**What and when**: It‚Äôs simple. I plan to share weekly updates on my progress. The first (this) update is on Building in public and Idea generation. The next few updates will be on problems I am exploring and how to decide on which problem to solve.

**How and where**: This blog is made using the paper-mod [Hugo blog template](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-papermod/) and hosted on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). I'm using this as an opportunity for learning to hack together a website. 

As I become less of a chicken, I might share these on twitter and linkedin.

Once I have more real stuff to show, I‚Äôll join a builder community as well, to further solve for accountability, clearer thinking and feedback. Some examples are [Pioneer](http://pioneer.app), [Megamaker](https://megamaker.co/join), [Makerlog](https://getmakerlog.com/), [YC startupschool](https://www.startupschool.org/), [Indie worldwide](https://indieworldwide.com/)

## üí°Generating startup ideas

I‚Äôm starting out by making what the collective entrepreneurship wisdom of the internet says is a mistake üò±. I don‚Äôt have a clear idea of what to build yet. So I‚Äôm relying on what I know best: doing research, using that to structure an approach, then following that approach and iterating as I learn. 

There are a few pieces of good advice on how to generate startup ideas. My key learning (and also one of the core principles of design thinking) is that success requires building a solution to an existing problem, rather than building a solution then finding a problem it can solve. 

So the plan I came up with to generate ideas (find problems?) is:

1. Oil up my idea machine by brainstorming daily based on prompts
    - Inspired by [this article](https://jamesaltucher.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-for-becoming-an-idea-machine/) from James Altucher
    - I found/made a bunch of prompts (notion kanban [here](https://www.notion.so/Brainstorming-prompts-874629599beb483fbbc4d41c735d681f)) based on the following articles
        - [How to Get Startup Ideas : YC Startup Library | Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/8g-how-to-get-startup-ideas)
        - [12 Frameworks for Finding Startup Ideas ‚Äî Advice for Future Founders](https://review.firstround.com/12-frameworks-for-finding-startup-ideas-advice-for-future-founders)
        - [How to generate better ideas](https://jakobgreenfeld.com/better-ideas)
2. Find some common promising themes between the ideas that keep coming up
3. Do deeper research on the above, guided by the following questions:
    - What are people complaining/asking about on the internet (reddit, quora, etc.)? *This article has a promising approach: [The Ultimate Guide to Unbundling Reddit](https://latecheckout.substack.com/p/the-ultimate-guide-to-unbundling)*
    - What problems are people using spreadsheets to solve? ***********************************************************I‚Äôve been living in spreadsheets for the past few years‚Ä¶***********************************************************
    - What problems do large businesses routinely spend a lot to solve (i.e. expensive legacy solutions, large teams)? ***************************************************Smaller businesses would need a cheap, automated solution, e.g. SaaS***************************************************

**Hopefully, that will create enough material to work with in the next phase - deciding what problem is worth solving *for me* (idea validation)*.***

### ‚û°Ô∏èNext steps

- Work on points 2 and 3 from above.
- Move the blog to github
- Write about the top 5 ideas I‚Äôm considering to moving to the next phase - validation
- Write about my approach to validation

Hey there! This is my last post for 2022, and I‚Äôll be back to the regular updates in 3 weeks. Thanks for reading my writing so far, for sharing your feedback and encouragement, and for keeping me accountable! 

### ‚¨ÖÔ∏èLast week, I set out to:

‚ùåPrepare for customer interviews

‚úÖTry to decide whether going into a super crowded space is worth it

‚úÖ[Maybe] Try to see how far I can get in building out one of the ideas above

Most of my progress so far has been inside my head or on paper. I was missing actually doing something. So I decided to first focus on trying to build a bare-bones version of a Slack bot that can use AI to generate images from a prompt (one of the ideas I shared last week was a way to ‚Äúgive more personalized [kudos](https://matterapp.com/kudos)¬†to colleagues, where each kudos comes with an¬†[AI-generated](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/)¬†greeting card‚Äù). This was a ton of learning, plus it helped me decide to move on from engagement tools. 

# ü§ñWhat I learned by building an AI-powered chat-bot

Let‚Äôs start with the obvious. I learned the technical parts of building the bot. I mainly followed these two [[1](https://renzolucioni.com/serverless-slash-commands-with-python/), [2](https://medium.com/@sanzgiri/a-dall-e-bot-for-slack-6aaa0d7c722)] tutorials for this. The coolest thing about it was that at each step, there was something that wouldn‚Äôt work as expected. Having to break my head and search for answers to fix things was when I learned the most. 

For example, I wanted to be able to call the bot using a slash command in Slack. To do this successfully, the bot needs to answer back within 3 seconds. However, the AI model takes around 15 seconds to come back with an image. Each tutorial had an answer for this, but I couldn‚Äôt get either to work. What worked in the end, was taking a break to cool off, then reading more about the platforms (slack, aws lambda) and packages (zappa and flask) I was using. A break + knowing how the technology worked helped me find the bug in my implementation. 

And now I can access [Stable Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion) through Slack to make my own cool images!
 
![santa](/chatbot/santa.png#center)

But building this app helped me understand more about the idea. I started from the hypothesis/feedback that kudos are not personalized enough, and that images generated by AI would make the kudos more personalized. However, when I got the bot to work, I realized three things:

1. Adding AI-generated images is too slow:
    - It takes about 15 seconds to generate an image
    - That‚Äôs too long for an instant messaging platform, where you expect things to be‚Ä¶ instant
    - Making it faster would lead to poor quality/too high costs
2. The images generated would either be not personalized or not relevant to kudos/recognition:
    - Recognition messages are typically something like ‚ÄúKaren, thank you so much for contributing to project Acme! We couldn‚Äôt have made the sale without you‚Äù. To this, a generalist model like stable diffusion responds with:
    
    ![karen](/chatbot/karen.png#center)
    
    - This means you‚Äôd have to tune the model. Maybe train the model with input images that inspire gratitude, recognition, encouragement, etc. However, I don‚Äôt think the resulting images would come out very personalized. They may be unique, inspire positive feelings, but they won‚Äôt be personalized.
3. I overestimated how ‚Äúcool‚Äù it would be to get these images. It‚Äôs not that cool. It‚Äôs cool when AI generates beautiful art, but it‚Äôs not that cool in the context of giving kudos to someone. 

# üí≠Closing thoughts

Spending time building made room for reflection on the real problems behind employee engagement. I realized that this is really a problem of relationships between people. The biggest cause of disengagement is that people don‚Äôt feel like their bosses and/or colleagues care about them. You don‚Äôt solve this using an app. You solve it by hiring/developing people that care about other people. 

Also, this space is overcrowded. So I‚Äôve decided to move on to something else. This means I‚Äôm back to exploring ideas. More on this next time.

# ‚û°Ô∏èNext steps

- Write up my checklist for an idea worth exploring
- Try more ways to find micro-saas ideas.

## Thanks for reading and happy holidays üéÖ!---

Hi and welcome to my weekly post! It‚Äôs been too long since we spoke last time, so why don‚Äôt you schedule a quick call with me [here](https://calendly.com/scortescu/30min)?

In the last post, I talked about my ideas for Slack apps. They were either in the AI space or focused on productivity or integrations. In this post, I cover how I thought about my elimination process and what was left after it. 

# üí°Choosing one idea to commit to

On one hand, I don‚Äôt feel like any of my ideas so far are that amazing. Even the ones I get very excited about, when I read them the next day, I think to myself ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs never going to work‚Äù or ‚ÄúWho needs that anyway?‚Äù On the other hand, real progress happens when you actually build something, show it to someone and iterate on the feedback. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm sticking to my deadline for committing to an idea today. 

I [previously](http://www.scortescu.com/posts/newyear2023/) wrote about my checklist for selecting an idea. That checklist filters for 3 main things:

1. Does the problem exist and is it worth solving?
2. Do I know who has the problem?
3. Can I imagine a solution that‚Äôs significantly better than existing ones?

*So how do my ideas fare against the checklist?*

## Sudden death

My three main productivity ideas (reminders for un-responded messages, wrappers for other collaborative bots and cloning OOO messages from email to Slack) have died a sudden death. 

The reason for dismissing all of them is that they don‚Äôt solve top problems. They are automations for things that don‚Äôt take that much time. So not really worth automating. 

These were joined in their death by my ideas to integrate Surveymonkey and LinkedIn notifications to slack. LinkedIn‚Äôs API actually doesn‚Äôt allow subscribing to notifications from any user (which is the main use case I was considering). However, the honest reason for both is that I find it hard to get excited about bringing notifications from one place (API) to another (Slack).  

![eliminated.gif](/commit/eliminated.gif#center)

## Runner ups

Two other ideas I touched on briefly were about integrating data from Sales (e.g. Pipedrive) or Support (e.g. Zendesk) tools into stats that help teams stay engaged and motivated. Think data-driven leaderboards and competitions. Tools like these are nothing new - even on Slack. Even better, they are standard, proven tools in money-making functions (e.g. sales). 

I‚Äôm putting a pin in these, and will come back to them in case I fail with‚Ä¶ 

## Bringing GPT-3 to Slack

Of course, you could say I just found excuses to dismiss the other things and am jumping on the shiny new thing. And you‚Äôd be right to some extent. However, jumping on a growing trend is also a strategy. There are now almost 1 million (!!!) searches per day for ‚Äúchat gpt‚Äù. 

![search.png](/commit/search.png#center)

But millions are millions. And GPT is helping those millions solve a few problems already. 

The way I‚Äôve come to think about Chat GPT is as an ‚Äúanalyst on my team‚Äù. Some of the things it does well is come up with ideas from a prompt (e.g. what are the economic drivers of a clothing store?), synthesize information (e.g. what is the main message in an article?) and write copy/code (e.g. write a message to a customer saying we need to . 

There‚Äôs even already a [tool](https://rationale.jina.ai/) that uses GPT to answer business questions using frameworks (e.g. cost-benefit, strengths-weaknesses-opportunities-threats). Also, companies are already paying people to think about business questions using frameworks (e.g. management consultants). 

However, one thing that I don‚Äôt like so much about using Chat GPT is having to go to their website (especially when it‚Äôs overloaded). I‚Äôd much rather stay somewhere where I already spend a lot of time: Slack. It‚Äôs a chat interface too, after all. 

So my goal for the next few weeks is to build a prototype of a bot that can answer questions according to a framework chosen by the user. Beep boop (image generated by my other slackbot).

# **üóø**How‚Äôs it going, Stefan

Thanks for asking! I‚Äôve recovered from my 3rd cold this winter. Not being able to work at 100% made me feel depressed. And trying to work while sick probably made it harder to recover‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve also been feeling more anxious in the past week. Putting a lot of pressure on myself to get this right. 

I‚Äôm trying to counter this by focusing on what I can learn, and where I can have most fun. This strategy is somewhat effective. 

# **‚û°Ô∏èNext steps**

- Write a Python script that can get a decent answer from OpenAI‚Äôs GPT3 to some generic business questions (e.g. ‚ÄúWrite a cost benefit analysis for laying off 10% of our workforce‚Äù)
- Make a first version of a Slack bot that implements the above Python script
- Build a landing page for the bot
- Come up with a name for the bot

Hi, and welcome to my building-in-public blog. This week‚Äôs update is a short one. I wasted too much time reading articles and too little time documenting research. Also got a cold. 

### **‚û°Ô∏è** Last week, I said I‚Äôll be working on:

1. Find potential customers and talk to them, starting with people managers and HR professionals in my network ‚Äî> *Will start preparing questions in the coming weeks, but will only reach out once the year ends,* *as I doubt I‚Äôll get many responses before that. Hopefully, understanding existing products should make for better questions.*
2. Build an MVP. TBD how functional it‚Äôs going to be (could be some mockups, a landing page, an actual add-on with basic functionality). The idea is to have something people can react to ‚Äî> *Will probably work on this in January/February.* 
3. Understand existing solutions, and what could be a unique angle of attack ‚Äî> *quick update below, as this is work in progress*

## ü§îCompetitive analysis

### What am I trying to understand by looking at the competition?

- What are the unique things that make each competitor attractive?
- What are common pain points with competitor‚Äôs products?
- How could I find a unique angle of attack?
    - In which parts of employee engagement (1-on-1s, recognition, feedback, performance reviews, pulse surveys) could there be an opportunity to do something differently, and better?

### After looking at 8 competitors in detail, here are my very rough hypotheses:

- Most existing solutions seem robotic, life-less. There‚Äôs an opportunity to make engagement tools more fun.
- Smaller companies (e.g. <200) want to do feedback, but current solutions are too-process focused
- Most solutions offer some analytics, but none (few?) seem to frame them for discussion (i.e. here‚Äôs a ready-made slide on the team pulse that you can use in the all-hands)
- Engagement surveys and recognition apps (e.g. kudos/high five/etc.) seem like the easiest to build but also most overdone/overcrowded spaces

## ‚û°Ô∏èNext steps

- Analyze ~40 more players in the space
- Start framing questions for user interviews---

Hi! Welcome to my blog, where I write about my path to building an internet business. 

I‚Äôm feeling better after last week‚Äôs cold, and excited about the holiday season: reading books and spending time with friends and family. Also, excited to share with you what I‚Äôve learned this week.

# üìëQuick recap

Three weeks ago I declared (üò¨) that I will be focusing on the employee engagement space. What I‚Äôve found since then is that this space is super-crowded, with hundreds of companies doing almost the same thing. These companies offer solutions regarding engagement, feedback, 1on1s, onboarding (I skipped this one) and recognition. See below more details and example products:

- **Engagement surveys (pulse)**- asking employees about their mood and attitude towards the company and team

![kona](/competition2/kona.gif#center)

- **Feedback** - structuring the process of asking for, giving and using feedback between peers and managers, both in time (when, how often, etc.) and in method (e.g. feedback frameworks)

![feedback](/competition2/feedback.svg#center)

- **1-on-1s** - a hot topic since the pandemic, this is about nudging and structuring frequent conversations between managers and employees with agendas, action items, note-taking, etc. I‚Äôve become more suspicious about tools like these. People mostly stay within their standard tools (email, calendar, docs/sheets), and structured 1:1 would have to be somewhere else, otherwise the UX would be too clunky (e.g. 1:1s embedded in google calendar). So people would need to get used to going to yet another communication/note-taking tool.
    
![1on1](/competition2/1on1.webp#center)
    
- **Recognition** (kudos & rewards) - this involves two things: facilitating employees praising each other and rewarding employees when they get a lot of praise

![recognition](/competition2/recognition.png#center)

## ‚û°Ô∏èNext steps from last week

- Analyze ~40 more players in the space
- Start framing questions for user interviews

# üìñLearnings from competitors

So, what did I learn by looking at ~50 companies in the space? I‚Äôll go through:

- Types of players
- Go-to-market
- Customer voice

## üïπÔ∏èTypes of players

There are **3 types of companies** in the employee engagement market segment:

- üíº*All-in-one solutions* that cover the entire engagement space (e.g. [15Five](https://www.15five.com/), [Cultureamp](https://www.cultureamp.com/)).
    - Almost all of these integrate with Slack, Teams, and tons of other systems
    - They aggressively advertise on top of each other, which tells me how competitive the market is
- üë∂*All-in-one wannabes* that cover 2-3 parts of the space ([Matter](https://matterapp.com/) does recognition and pulse surveys), and also typically integrate with multiple systems
- üé†*One-trick-ponies* that do‚Ä¶ one thing ([Kona](https://www.heykona.com/) only does pulse) and are typically on one platform only (e.g. Slack)

## üö°Go-to-market

### Marketing

All companies in the space produce **massive amounts of content** (e.g. blog articles) to get customers through search engines (for example, Cultureamp ranks really well for ‚Äúwork games‚Äù). This means I‚Äôd have to do the same to get users organically (i.e. not chase them myself). 

Aside from the hundreds of live solutions, there seems to be a **graveyard of products** (see some [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Slack/comments/x6d215/feedback_allin1_engagement_app_native_to_slack/) and [producthunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/wellbee) ‚Äúlaunches‚Äù) that never took off. They may also have given up before investments in marketing started paying off. 

### Pricing

Companies in the space tend to charge for each user, and prices vary between $2/user/month and $15/user/month. Assuming a target revenue of $5000/month and a 2$/user/month price point, I‚Äôd have to get 2500 users, or less than 100 companies larger than 20 people to live a comfortable life on some beach in Europe. That seems like something I could grind through, despite there being so many competitors

### Competitive edges

While not very-data driven, my gut feeling based on what I‚Äôve seen so far is that there are 5 factors that companies are using as competitive edges:  

- **All-in-one** - just the fact that a product offers all kinds of engagement solutions seems to be a selling point. In fact, some all-in-one-wannabees and one-trick-ponies try to make it look like they are all-in-one (e.g. [empuls](https://www.empuls.io/), [suberbeings](https://www.superbeings.ai/), [kona](https://www.heykona.com/))
- **Simplicity** - simple UI and UX, not trying to do too much, ease of setting up
- **Science** - having some scientific studies behind the questions asked in surveys, the way feedback is structured, etc. Sometimes, just having some HBR and McKinsey articles, or ‚Äúdeveloping in collaboration with psychologists‚Äù seems to do the trick
- **Analytics** - this can range from some basic dashboards up to more AI-based advanced insights (e.g. detecting risk of burnout from survey responses)
- **Language, design & story**- Companies try to use more empathetic language, eye-catching design and colors to make their products attractive. That‚Äôs an old trick. What‚Äôs surprising is that some engagement products try to build an attractive story behind their product. [Kona](https://www.heykona.com/) has a dog mascot, that asks you how you‚Äôre doing. Matter tries to make a ritual around feedback with [Feedback Friday](https://matterapp.com/feedback-friday).

## üó£Ô∏èCustomer voice

I‚Äôve gone through hundreds of customer reviews for these products. Some common themes that I‚Äôve seen across customer reviews are below:

- General likes:
    - Science & psychology - based surveys and feedback approaches
    - Being able to benchmark against other companies
    - Getting more feedback, recognition and generally having more and better conversations. While this may sound obvious, people sometimes just need a more ‚Äúofficial‚Äù reason or channel to do something.
- General dislikes:
    - Difficulty in setting-up the solution (e.g. connecting it to all the right systems)
    - With all-in-one solutions, people often complain about too many features
    - Data analysis/aggregation being difficult for more complex orgs, and not meaningful for smaller companies
    - Too frequent notifications and repetitiveness can get on people‚Äôs nerves and backfire with disengagement, cynicism
    - Lack of personalization (e.g. ability to add links to content, images or gifs)
- Conflicting opinions:
    - Structure - some people complain when they don‚Äôt have enough guidance, while others feel constrained by inflexibility (e.g. you need to do your 1:1 exactly like THIS). Structure can also give the impression of substance, while inviting superficiality.
    - Anonymity - some people don‚Äôt like the lack of accountability that comes with anonymous ratings and feedback, while others feel like they can be more honest because of anonymity. The same applies to public recognition, which comes with a drop in anonymity.
    - Language bias - some solutions (e.g. Officevibe) tend to have more positive/hippy language in their questions, nudges, etc. This helps make some people feel safer, while others feel manipulated

# üí≠Closing thoughts

Generally, this looks like an overcrowded space. To win, or at least not die in it, I probably need to invest a lot into marketing, or to understand a very specific niche ( üôèhit me up if you have any ideas). Plus, I‚Äôd need to do something differently. 

My best ideas so far are:

- **Pulse:** Company pulse surveys that can also be shared outside the company, to show a culture of transparency, and maybe attract hires. This could also backfire
- **Recognition**:
    - Giving [kudos](https://matterapp.com/kudos) to colleagues, where each kudos comes with an [AI-generated](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/) ‚Äúgreeting card‚Äù that‚Äôs based on the message included in the kudos. This is based on feedback that existing tools lack personalization.
    - Using days off as the currency for recognition. For example, each employee could get 1 day every year, that they could give away (in tiny chunks) to their colleagues, as a thank-you. This is based on feedback that reward redemption can be difficult, and because‚Ä¶ who doesn‚Äôt like time off?

## ‚û°Ô∏èNext steps

- Prepare for customer interviews
    - Build a pipeline of people to talk to (end users, HR leaders, people managers)
    - Write up interview guides for each type
- Try to decide whether going into a super crowded space is worth it
- [Maybe] Try to see how far I can get in building out one of the ideas above---
title: "#23 Iro - (not) a therapy chatbot"
date: 2023-07-23T17:29:25+02:00
draft: false
---
Hi there! Today I want to share a bit more about [Iro](https://heyiro.com/) - the project I started at Antler, with my cofounder Nalla. 

Before I dive into that, a quick note on the new blog frequency: I‚Äôll now try to share bi-weekly updates, instead of weekly. You can also now subscribe to be notified when there‚Äôs a new post. Just add your email [here](https://tinyletter.com/sscortescu) (you‚Äôll receive an email asking you to confirm - make sure you do üôÇ)

# ü§ñAn introduction to Iro

## Why build yet another (non)therapy chatbot?

First, I need to share that Iro will start as more of an emotional companion that is trained with therapeutic methodologies. Claiming something is actual therapy is heavily regulated in most countries, and takes certification work for which the regulation is not even there yet. 

Moving on, my and my cofounder‚Äôs motivation to work on this is simple. We are both passionate about how people think and feel, and how they can do this in the healthiest way possible. Mental health is something we deeply care about - both for ourselves and for others. If everyone‚Äôs mental health was even 1% better, we‚Äôd be living in a wildly different world ü§©.

But we‚Äôre living in a world where at least [an eight of the population live with a mental health disorder](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-disorders). People want to get help, but almost half are prevented from getting it either by [cost](https://www.thenationalcouncil.org/news/lack-of-access-root-cause-mental-health-crisis-in-america/) or [stigma](https://www.healio.com/news/psychiatry/20190614/many-people-with-mental-health-disorders-do-not-receive-treatment). 

We don‚Äôt aim to replace existing solutions such as therapy or medication. But we want to create a high-quality, affordable solution that can help the people whose access to care is currently limited. We believe that the latest advancements in artificial intelligence (i.e. large language models such as ChatGPT) allow for a much better solution that the existing therapy-like chatbots.   

## Progress so far

Our first milestone is to validate Iro‚Äôs value proposition. We ran around 40 user interviews with potential users as well as with experienced therapists to understand how such a solution could look like. They told us about their struggles with mental health, the solutions they have tried, and how they would envision using an AI emotional companion. 

Based on these learnings, we launched a survey with 100 people to confirm and quantify these learnings. This helped us go from ‚Äúpeople want/struggle with Y‚Äù to ‚Äúx% of people want/struggle with Y‚Äù. We used this to focus and refine our messaging, and build mockups for how Iro could look like. 

At this stage, a validated value proposition means a reasonable ratio between the cost to acquire a customer (CAC), and the revenue this customer could bring. We can estimate the revenue the revenue part with publicly available data. To learn about the CAC, we‚Äôre now running an ad campaign asking people to sign up to Iro‚Äôs waiting list. The cost we‚Äôll end up paying/signup will be a proxy for the CAC. 

Check out one of our ads below, and let me know what you think!

![ad](/iro_w1/ad.png#center)

## Next steps

If we manage to validate the value proposition, the next step is to build a proof-of-concept prototype. Something useable and valuable, but without all the bells and whistles. To do this, we‚Äôll need to involve clinicians to help us design Iro in a way that makes therapeutic sense. Luckily, we‚Äôre already in discussions with some really knowledgeable (and excited) therapists. 

We‚Äôll then iterate this prototype until the end of year with the initial users that sign up to the waiting list. This will require further marketing and communication effort. To speed up development, we‚Äôll also be looking to bring more people on the team, including a CTO who can both develop a mobile app, and work with large language models (hit me up if you know anyone)

In the next update, I‚Äôll share more about how the marketing campaign went, and how (if) we‚Äôre building toward a proof of concept.

# **üóøPersonal update:¬†How‚Äôs it going, Stefan?**

I‚Äôm very happy with the progress we‚Äôre making so far with Iro. Aside from that, I‚Äôm recovering well from my ankle sprain, so things are looking up for doing the Eindhoven marathon in October.

title: "#24 Wrapping up two projects"
date: 2023-10-05T09:17:24+02:00
draft: false
---

Hi and welcome to my wantrepreneurship blog!

The past two months have been yet another roller coaster that ended in‚Ä¶ well it didn‚Äôt end the way I hoped. I wish the title of this blog was ‚ÄúFirst customers using the app - learnings‚Äù, but today‚Äôs post is more of a post-mortem. In fact, it‚Äôs two post mortems in one. 

However, that‚Äôs not a bad thing (well not completely). In 2023 alone, I can count 5 projects and/or teams that I‚Äôve started and stopped, so far. Even if they didn‚Äôt grow to become ‚Äúreal things‚Äù, giving up on each of them was hard. But every time, I learned a new way to *let go*, which is an important spiritual and emotional skill. 

# Iro - campaign results and wrap up

*Quick reminder: [Iro](https://heyiro.com/) was a mental health AI companion that I started with someone I met in the Antler program.* 

In my last post, I discussed why it‚Äôs important to validate Iro‚Äôs value proposition before building the actual product: It‚Äôs to make sure people are even remotely interested in what we offer. To test this, we ran ads to get people to sign up to Iro‚Äôs waiting list. 

This was supposed to give a *rough* idea of the cost to acquire a customer (CAC), and determine if there‚Äôs a business case for the project. What‚Äôs a good CAC, you ask? Ideally, it should be free - word-of-mouth, baby! But we can‚Äôt want to wait for words to be exchanging mouths when there‚Äôs not much to word about ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 

Taking market averages for conversion rates down the funnel (e.g. waiting list to install, install to paid), we get a picture of **how freaking hard B2C and mobile apps can be!** Unless you can have very low cost-per-click (cheap ads), you need amazing conversion rates from ad to waiting list. 

Check out the chart below, where I plot the Cost of Acquisition against ad cost (Cost-per-click) and conversion. If the conversion rate is 40% (which is amazing), we‚Äôd need  an ad cost of EUR 0.2 (which is super-cheap) to reach a CAC of EUR 50. At a price of EUR 70, we‚Äôre left with EUR20 to run the company, and that‚Äôs no-bueno üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è for a software company.

![cac](/iro_wrapup/cac.png#center)

I heard B2C is ‚Äúhard‚Äù from multiple people, multiple times. Only after making this chart, did I believe it. However, ‚Äúhard‚Äù doesn‚Äôt have to be a show stopper. Doing ‚Äúhard‚Äù things is awesome! So we went ahead with the campaign. 

And then we didn't get close to the results we were aiming for. We had agreed to stop the project if we couldn‚Äôt validate the value proposition, so no problem - right? But this hurt nonetheless. As with romantic break-ups, business break-ups can be painful and confusing. Even when it‚Äôs a planned breakup. 

If there is one fundamental reason for this one beyond the flopped campaign, it‚Äôs founder compatibility. On paper, we were extremely compatible, matching on almost all of the [50 questions](https://proof-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/firstround/50%20Questions%20for%20Co-Founders.pdf) (founder compatibility discussion prompts). People of course are (mostly) not on paper. We tend to act differently from synthetic (ideal?) descriptions of ourselves. We also never fully assimilate synthetic description of others.

 

So Iro is ‚ò†Ô∏è. What‚Äôs next? 

# Pronto - forming and storming

Shortly after wrapping up Iro, I learned about another co-founder matching program happening in Paris - [Hook](https://hook.vc/co-founder-boat). It lasted a month, it‚Äôs backed by [42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(school)), and there are no strings attached unless you get their investment at the end (5% for 50k + a 3 month incubator). The program itself was scrappier (in a good way) and more down-to-earth than Antler.

After the first week at Hook, I teamed up with two people (another business generalist like myself and a product engineer). All three of us had experience with Sales or Sales Operations topics, so we did about 30 customer discovery interviews to understand pain points in this area. When one of our interviews ended with a lot of noise (customer getting very emotional about a problem), we decided to pursue that idea.  

If you‚Äôve ever done any cold outreach, or any customer outreach for that matter, you will know how painful it can be. You write to 100s or 1000s of prospects to maybe get a few meetings booked. If you want to have a slightly better response rate, you need to personalize your message for every customer. And that‚Äôs hard.

*Fun fact: there are 127 trillion emails going around every year, of which roughly 10 billion are outreach emails sent by sales people to other businesses.* 

Enter video. More and more, businesses send video messages to sell to each other instead of text. While it may sound awkward at first, video converts much better. An outbound agency owner we interviewed (confirmed by stats on the internet) told us emails with a personalized video message inside convert 2-3 times better. But making videos, especially a lot of them is hard and takes long. 

**Double hard!**

![sales](/iro_wrapup/sales.png#center)

We had started talking to more customers to validate the problem-solution fit, while hacking together the first version of a solution. People were interested and eager to see a demo. 

However, we hit a founder compatibility wall after our second round of pitching to Hook - this time it was a combination of values, working styles and role definition. One of the team members left the team, and we are still talking with the other one about how/whether to continue together.  

# **üóøPersonal update:¬†How‚Äôs it going, Stefan?**

While the above may sound negative, I don‚Äôt think of it that way. I‚Äôm learning a lot (hope to write more about that soon), every time. 

I‚Äôve also been keeping my mood up with the marathon training. Writing this on the Paris-Amsterdam train, I can‚Äôt help the excitement - race day is Sunday October 8th.

title: "#7 More brainstorming"
date: 2023-01-18T18:22:59+01:00
draft: false
---

Hi and thanks for coming by! Short update this week.

In my last post, I finished with a list of ways to find micro-Saas ideas, that I planned to use.   

One of the ways was trying find inspiration in SaaS idea newsletters. So, for the past week-and-a-bit, I've been doing that, which produced some moderate results. Here‚Äôs a dump of ideas:

```
Idea dump
* Taxfix for solopreneurs
* Bubble plugin that takes webform data to google sheets
* Linktree-style website builder for doctors and other independent practitioners, 
including appointment booking, payments, loyalty. If Doctolib is Amazon, this is Shopify
* Invoice generator from Notion/Coda
* Some CMS ideas:
** Knowledgebase that uses Airtable/Coda to manage it's content
** Use Airtable/Notion/Coda to manage content in Wordpress/Wix/Webflow or other website builders
** Airtable/Notion/Coda to manage a simple productroadmap page, including feature upvote
* Subscription flow/billing plugin for Wordpress/Wix/Webflow
* Competitor comparison page generator based on G2/Capterra data
* Manage (write, schedule, analytics) linkedin posts from notion/coda/airtable
* [Shopify plugin] Scan QR code to take cart to mobile device and continue shopping 
```

Another way to find ideas that I‚Äôve read about and thought attractive, is to find popular apps on one platform (e.g. Shopify) and try to build it on a competitor‚Äôs platform (e.g. Woocommerce). So i found a [list of platforms that have app marketplaces](https://rocketgems.com/blog/saas-marketplaces/). To better understand if these platforms are a good fit, I looked at 3 things: size, growth and whether they have documentation for building with Python (the programming language I‚Äôm least of a noob in). I also filtered out any platform that I know nothing about. 

The top 10 biggest platforms from this list are:

1. Zoom
2. G Suite/Google Workspace
3. Shopify
4. Wix
5. Slack
6. Salesforce
7. Figma
8. Wordpress
9. Stripe
10. Coda

The top 10 fastest growing platforms are:

1. Hubspot
2. JotForm
3. Figma
4. Airtable
5. Magento
6. Webflow
7. Monday
8. Typeform
9. Salesforce
10. Zendesk

So I went through the documentation of each of these platforms, and it looks like only **Slack** enables building using Python. Some other platforms (e.g. Stripe) enable building things with Python, but not for apps on their marketplaces. This forces a choice on me between investing into learning a new programming language (I know some Python) or focusing on Slack. With Slack being one of the bigger platforms, typically used by companies that seem to often spend money on apps in the store, I don't think it's the worst forced choice.   

# **How‚Äôs it going, Stefan**

With a few more and diverse ideas, I feel more positive than last week. I've also been going to Improv classes and a few meetups (a solopreneur meetup and a product management meetup). It feels good to be able to talk to people going through similar moments in their lives.

# **‚û°Ô∏èNext steps**

Keep brainstorming. Next, I‚Äôll try to find apps that work well on one platform but aren‚Äôt on a competitive platform yet.---

Hi, and welcome to my building-in-public blog. The past week hasn‚Äôt been as productive as my inner critic keeps peddling, but I‚Äôve managed to work on all the next steps I set out in my previous post. 

![fine.jfif](/ndts/fine.jfif#center)

### Next steps from last week

‚úÖ **Find common promising themes across brainstorming notes:** expanding on that in the next section

‚úîÔ∏è **Write about the top 5 ideas I‚Äôm considering to moving to the next phase (validation) -** hard to give myself a full checkmark for this one, as it‚Äôs really only one idea. But that‚Äôs fine

‚úÖ **Move the blog to GitHub** - I set up the domain, website code and hosting. Took me one day to do it, but it was great learning and feels great to have an actual work product

‚úÖ Write about my approach to validation 

![serious.jpeg](/ndts/serious.jpeg#center)

## üëÅÔ∏è Promising themes

To find some common threads, I went to my brainstorming notes and reflected back on conversations with friends. I keep going back to the following topics: team/employee experience & engagement, mental health, collaboration & productivity, artificial intelligence. 

My evidence for the below is anecdotal. That means they are starting hypotheses, to be refined. 

### Team/employee experience & engagement

I‚Äôve been an long time complainer about managers, company dynamics, team dynamics and so on. In a team, when things go well, there‚Äôs little incentive to reflect, be vulnerable (to get to the root of issues) or do much more than ‚Äújob tasks‚Äù. However, things aren‚Äôt always going as well as it seems on the surface. 

Remote work took away a lot of the self-regulation mechanisms that being in the same room or building provide. Some examples that come to mind: guessing how your team mate feels when you see them in the coffee room; learning & adapting to someone‚Äôs style by working next to each other. We flatten people down into Slack handles, email addresses and blurry faces in conference calls. I‚Äôm not surprised that people keep leaving their jobs, and one of the big reasons for this they don‚Äôt feel leaders and colleagues care for them or their growth ([McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/the-great-attrition-is-making-hiring-harder-are-you-searching-the-right-talent-pools)).  

![b2o.png](/ndts/b2o.png#center)

**The problem**: In a distributed work environment, growing and maintaining employee experience & engagement requires tools that most managers are not equipped with, and structure that most teams can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt build on their own. 

### Mental health

I‚Äôve also been a long time mental health enthusiast. Coming from a curiosity about how people think & feel, my own struggles with depression, anxiety & relationships, and a constant need to understand analyze, it‚Äôs hard for me not to ideate on mental health topics. Also, I‚Äôm crazy ü§™.  

**Two problems:**

- Access to mental health care in Europe is difficult enough, because there are not enough practitioners, and getting insurers to cover expenses is difficult if not impossible. Even when insurers will pay, they‚Äôll only do it for practitioners licensed in the country you live in. That makes it almost impossible for expats to get care.
- Most mental health workers don‚Äôt (have time to?) treat their practice as a real business, aside from the bare minimal. There seems to be room to professionalize the operations behind e.g. therapists practices. Think scheduling, customer relationship management, billing, record keeping, etc.

### Collaboration & productivity

If collaboration and productivity solutions were an animal, I think they would be an ant üêú. There are too many of them, they divide labor to solve complex problems, and each individual ant is totally replaceable, except the queen (MS Excel in this metaphor). 

**Two productivity/collaboration problems I‚Äôve encountered over and over:**

- Following up on people for things is frustrating, necessary and easy to let slip through the cracks. I‚Äôve come across this every time I needed someone else‚Äôs output on a deadline (especially when they have a different boss), and found myself writing those cringe ‚ÄúJust following up on this..‚Äù mails/slacks.
- Companies make decisions all the time, but with endless meetings and debates, many seem to get lost. Sometimes these are important decisions that end up being a company‚Äôs strategy. I have yet to see decisions being documented and communicated through something more than email and slides.

### ‚ùîWhat to focus on

**Team/employee experience & engagement** is really the topic that I can‚Äôt stop thinking about at the moment. I‚Äôve spent much of the past week reading about existing companies in the space, and keep thinking ‚ÄúI wish I had built this‚Äù. Some companies that seem to have made it in this space are [CultureAmp](https://www.cultureamp.com/), [Leapsome](https://www.leapsome.com/), [Lattice](https://lattice.com/) and [15Five](https://www.15five.com/) (used and loved this one in a previous job). There are many others.  

There is a set of behaviors and tools that I learned in consulting, that I think helps improve engagement, and that I don‚Äôt think is used (well) enough in most companies. The companies I mentioned above tackle at least one of:

- Regularly taking the team‚Äôs pulse, learning how they feel about things that matter to them, talking about it and making changes
- Having structured 1-on-1 conversations, both on harder (content, work process) and softer (relationship, wellbeing) topics
- Getting and giving (frequent)
    - Appreciation
    - Actionable feedback
- Explicitly learning about each other‚Äôs working & communication styles, routines, preferences, strengths and aspirations
- Structuring a proper onboarding and offboarding for new hires and exits both at company and team level

Aside from my passion for these problems and how excited I get about these tools, here are a three other reasons why I plan to further explore this topic:

- Some of the issues seem big enough to have an impact on engagement, but small enough for a one-man-team (me) to build a bootstrapped solution around
- They‚Äôre a great fit for building something within an existing, growing communication platform that enables add-ons, such as Slack, Teams, Zoom, etc. This means there‚Äôs an existing distribution channel, and higher chances of people discovering my solution
- There‚Äôs some connection to mental health, and I hope to flesh it out

![idea.png](/ndts/idea.png#center)

## ‚û°Ô∏è Next steps: Validation

Validation is a smart-sounding word, but it can mean different things for different people at different stages of a company. For me, this will be about making the below problem more concrete. 

> In a distributed work environment, growing and maintaining employee experience & engagement requires tools that most managers are not equipped with, and structure that most teams can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt build on their own.
> 

The questions that I hope to answer:

‚ùìDoes the problem really exist? 

‚ùìWhat are the root causes? 

‚ùìWhat is really hard or painful about it? 

‚ùìHow are people solving it? 

‚ùìWhat works and doesn‚Äôt work with existing solutions?  

This will mean that I‚Äôll be working on a few things in parallel:

- Find potential customers and talk to them, starting with people managers and HR professionals in my network
- Build an MVP. TBD how functional it‚Äôs going to be (could be some mockups, a landing page, an actual add-on with basic functionality). The idea is to have something people can react to
- Understand existing solutions, and what could be a unique angle of attack

Hi there, and thanks for reading my blog and for your feedback üíö! It‚Äôs making a huge difference, in that it forces me to make my thinking clearer and it makes this ‚Äújourney‚Äù less lonely.

In my last post, I wrote about deciding to drop the field of employee engagement. As next steps, I proposed to:

- Write up my checklist for an idea worth exploring

# üéáSnippets from my review for 2022

For the third year in a row, I take 2-3 days at the end of the year to reflect on the past 12 months. In this review, I think of what I learned then set some goals for the coming year. 

So here are my biggest learnings for 2022:

- **Making things**: I learned to take criticism (feedback?) better (less personally). My last boss had a never-ending supply of feedback, which made this learning possible. It really takes a lot of tries and iterations to make something great. So the energy that goes into frustration about not getting right the first time is much needed in those next iterations.
- **Freedom:** I long for freedom. Lately, in my career, I long for creative and financial freedom. But I am as free or as captive as I want to be (mostly). Freedom is often a choice between fear transforming into a) inaction and then into sadness or b) into anger or curiosity and then into action and joy. Freedom is in your head.
- **Committing**: It‚Äôs hard to know what you want until you try a few things. Or until you lose something that you used to discount. When you realize what you want, commit. Go all in.

**My biggest failure for 2022** was how short a time I spent in my last job. There was still so much to learn. However, leaving a toxic environment was important for my health. And this allowed me to finally jump into‚Ä¶this üòä

### Moving on to 2023, there are 3 main goals that I want to focus on:

1. Build a business that brings me EUR 2k in monthly revenue
2. Run a marathon in under 4 hours 
3. Grow my existing friendships and make new ones 

# ü§óHow‚Äôs it going, Stefan

*Thanks for asking! I‚Äôm thinking of making this a permanent section in the blog. This way, I can keep the complaining isolated, and you can skip it. Win win!* 

It‚Äôs hitting me that after 1 and a half months of work, I don‚Äôt yet have something solid to jump on. Having missed my previous deadline (December 2022) for settling on an idea and starting to develop it is creating some anxiety. So I‚Äôm putting a lot of pressure on myself to find a problem worth solving. That‚Äôs creating anxiety, which I turn into procrastination - you know, because it‚Äôs impossible to fail at scrolling on LinkedIn. 

Rationally, I understand that no matter what I‚Äôll start, it will probably look completely different after a few months and again after a few years. Hell, the first few things will probably fail miserably. Emotionally, I‚Äôm not there yet. But I feel like there is some progress though. My inner voice is becoming less self critical and more kind. It takes work, but it‚Äôs working‚Ä¶.you can quote me on this.

**So‚Ä¶new deadline: whatever best idea I have by the end of January, I‚Äôll run with it.**

![doit.png](/newyear2023/doit.png#center)

# ‚òëÔ∏èMy checklist for an idea worth exploring

My goal for this business is to reach a comfortable semi-passive income, while building it (mostly) alone. The business model that I think fits this goal best is SaaS, or more specifically, micro-Saas. 

SaaS stands for Software as a Service, which means selling software that customers pay for on a monthly basis. Salesforce, Contentful, Notion are SaaS-es. Micro-SaaS is‚Ä¶ a smaller SaaS. It offers one or very few features, for a niche segment of customers, and is typically augmenting an existing, larger SaaS. Think of plugins, addons and extensions.   

I prepared a checklist to guide me in selecting an idea that‚Äôs not üí© wrapped in üç¨. The checklist tries to make sure that the problem exists, that it‚Äôs worth solving, that I know who has it. Also, I should at least be able to imagine building a solution.

- **Problem - exists and is worth solving**
    - There is money already being spent to solve problem (other soft, consultants, etc)
    - It‚Äôs a top problem (touches making money/acquiring customers, drastic cost saving, significant automation)
    - I can find more than 20 people that confirm the problem exists, and they represent more than 60% of the people I talked to
    - I can estimate more than 50k potential customers
- **Customers - do I know who has the problem?**
    - Customer segment well defined (Managers - not well defined; Data engineering team leads in companies with 200-1000 employees - well defined)
    - I like the customers in this segment
    - I know where to find customers in this segment
- **Solution**
    - I can imagine a way to build a 5x better/cheaper solution
    - The solution can be built on a top of a growing platform

# ü§ØMore ways to find micro-SaaS ideas

*‚Ä¶and how it‚Äôs going so far*

1. **Steal from freelancers**

What this means is browsing through freelance job websites like Upwork, Freelancer and Guru, and finding common patterns in the jobs that are repeating themselves. 

I‚Äôve done this for 2 days. Results: 0Ô∏è‚É£

2. **Find problems on Reddit (and other communities)** 

I wrote about this in my [first post](http://www.scortescu.com/posts/bip/). People complain about things and ask questions on Reddit, so it‚Äôs a good source for problems. If you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre looking for, this can be a huge time sink. I‚Äôll come back to it in a few days/weeks. 

I tried this for a day. Results: 0Ô∏è‚É£. But then I found [GummySearch](gummysearch.com), which automatically synthesizes information on Reddit. So I‚Äôll come back to it.

3. **Find inspiration in SaaS idea newsletters**

There‚Äôs a ton of other people like me looking for ideas to build. Which is why there are also newsletters and blogs that write about specific (micro-SaaS) ideas (e.g. Business Brainstorms, and MicroSaasIdea). My approach here is select 1-2 idea from each issue, and give it my own twist. I also try to use them to create prompts for brainstorming more ideas

*This is my approach at the moment*. Some results:

```
**Idea dump**
- Turn Notion templates into analog products (not SaaS)
- Copy Substack newsletter issues to your website
- Uber for moldovan contractors (plumbers, etc) (marketplace, not SaaS)
- Shared shopping cart for couples on Shopify stores
- Turning books ands self improvement methods into mobile apps (not SaaS)
- Consultants on demand to help you on your powerpoint deck now (productized service)
- One dashboard to monitor and reply to customer reviews from different platforms (in Slack?)
```

4. **Make an analytics tool for a large growing platform**

This can help e.g. LinkedIn professional users analyze their performance. A few tools exist (e.g. [Hootsuite](https://hootsuite.com/)) in this space, especially for social media. The trick is to find growing platforms that are still underserved. 

5. **Automate manual tasks - based on interviews**

Find small business owners ‚û°Ô∏è Ask them about their most annoying recurring tasks - how do they deal with them currently, how much would they pay to have it done for them automagically

6. **Niche down big SaaS**

Take some very broad business pain points that are currently addressed by big SaaS companies - contact management, lead generation, sales pipelines, time tracking, billing and invoice management, scheduling, planning, etc. Cross that with a specific professional/industrial/functional niche.

Keep brainstorming using the approaches above

I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs been two months (three including breaks) of writing! One of the cool things about writing here is that I go back to what I wrote, to check what I was thinking last week. When a lot of my output is ‚Äúthinking‚Äù, that helps me build on top of what I previously thought.  

In today‚Äôs post:

- üí°**Ideas:** Last week‚Äôs top ideas
- üóø**Status**: How‚Äôs it going, Stefan
- ‚û°Ô∏è**Next steps**: *Step nexts*

# üí°Last week‚Äôs top ideas

In previous posts I shared ideas as a brain dump. However, now that I‚Äôm focusing on [Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/115004071768-What-is-Slack-) apps, I thought it could be interesting to give more details about my thinking. 

There are four areas where my attention keeps drifting and where my inspiration keeps giving: (¬©Ô∏è üòÇ) Artificial Intelligence, Productivity and Integrations. 

## Artificial Intelligence

If you are on Twitter or Linkedin, your eyes are probably bleeding from all the talk about (Chat-)GPT. If not, quick intro: 

- GPT-3 is an artificial intelligence language model
- Chat GPT is a chat bot built on top of GPT-3
- Chat GPT has been blowing people‚Äôs minds what the things that it can do, including answer questions (well enough pass an [MBA exam](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/chatgpt-passes-mba-exam-wharton-professor-rcna67036)), write code/poetry/anything(?) and summarize information
- [Dozens of companies](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-10-gpt-3-powered-applications-to-know-in-2022/) are jumping on the hype and building things using the GPT models (anyone can use the paid API)

Applied to the context of Slack, there are 4 main problems that AI could probably solve well:

- **Unblock people from starting/replying to conversations.** It could help you rewrite a message to sound more polite or add clarifying details. If you let the AI learn from your previous chats, it could reply the way you would usually respond.
- **Help you not miss important information** from different channels, while not having to read every single message. It can also guess the general emotions (if e.g. people are unhappy) in a discussion.
- **Write code in your place.** GPT can start from a simple prompt (e.g. write a script to scrape the reddit), translate programming languages and even find + fix bugs
- **Answer general/specific knowledge questions**. GPT knows about most of the information that was on the internet in 2021. But you can also train it with more information. Make it read a specific book and it will be able to answer questions from it.  Make it read messages from your colleague Karen, and it will be able to answer from her voice.

## Productivity

The market for productivity apps has been overcrowded for years. But there always seems to be room for one more app. Below are three problems that I personally would like solved as a corporate Slack user: 

- **Remind you of messages** that you‚Äôve read but haven‚Äôt responded to, or of your messages that no one has responded to yet. This has been a personal problem of mine. Would definitely make my life less stressful
- **Wrap collaborative bots**: On a daily basis, I‚Äôd get notifications about comments in Google Docs, Sheets, Loom, Figma, Jira, etc, eating up my focus. Would be cool to have one place for all content discussions, that‚Äôs not a new place (e.g. Slack, not an extra app)
- **Auto-reply with my Gmail/Outlook out-of-office message**, when I go on holiday. Current apps just notify the person that you‚Äôre out-of-office. Slack also has a Status that you can update manually (many people forget though).

## Integrations

Most people that use Slack also use all kinds of other apps. Those apps generate data and notifications. However, context switching is hard - going from app to app makes you lose focus. Slack is often an app people already spend a large chunk of their time. 

Below are some integrations that: 

- Are not on Slack yet but are getting some search traffic:
    - Surveymonkey  - no integration, 50 searches/month
    - Linkedin - weak integration, 120 searches/month
- Are already on Slack but there‚Äôs so much search traffic that there could be place for one more app: Jira
- Can help motivate sales teams by bringing stats and producing leaderboards from data in fast-growing CRMs (e.g.: [arena](https://lennysnewsletter.slack.com/apps/AMGQZF7T3-arena-for-hubspot?tab=more_info)/[salescompete](https://lennysnewsletter.slack.com/apps/A013KPUTPG8-salescompete-for-outreach-hubspot?tab=more_info) for [Pipedrive](https://www.notion.so/Max-Mitcham-on-LinkedIn-data-gpt3-sales-45-comments-85d490e554ad4764bccca485f7fc87e3))
- Same idea but for customer support (e.g. [Supportman](https://lennysnewsletter.slack.com/apps/AAPANKAKT-zoho-desk?tab=more_info) for zendesk/gorgias/qualified/crisp/hubspot livechat/support)

The logic behind the last two points is that these are centered around Sales and Support tools. That means they are used to get or retain customers. So customers are more willing to spend money on them.

# üóøHow‚Äôs it going, Stefan?

Thanks for asking! I‚Äôve got another cold (3rd one this winter). Kind of depressed that I‚Äôm getting sick so often lately and worried that my training for the Paris semi-marathon on March 5th will suffer. But also, maybe I should dress better when running 15k at -2 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 

Quite happy with my progress in the past few weeks. From the list above, there are a few things that I can get excited about building. 

Thoughts going through my mind:

- Is it worth riding a trend like GPT3?
- Who would pay for yet another small improvement in productivity?

# ‚û°Ô∏èNext steps

- Make a shortlist from the ideas I shared above, and run them through my [checklist](http://www.scortescu.com/posts/newyear2023/) + write up more about the actual problems to be solve
- Write about how I scraped the Slack app marketplace with the help of ChatGPT. It‚Äôs very frustrating that there are no stats about apps on the Slack app Marketplace. So I decided to get some data myself.---

Hi and thanks for coming to my blog!

In my last post I wrote about committing to build a Slack app that gives access to the GPT AI language model. This week I‚Äôve thought more about what exactly this app should be doing and also had great progress in building a prototype. In this post, I will be covering:

- üî≠ **Vision**: When my bot grows up, what will it become?
- üõ¥**Minimum Viable** **Product**: Current state and what‚Äôs still missing
- üóø**Personal update:** How‚Äôs it going, Stefan?
- ‚û°Ô∏è**Next steps:** Step nexts

# üî≠Vision: When my bot grows up, what will it become?

The vision for the bot is to serve as a business analyst working for decision makers and the teams that support them. It is targeted at CEOs, consultants (internal and external), and (real üòÄ) business analysts across strategy and operations functions. These people often need to think about ambiguous business problems in structured, analytical ways. 

However, they might miss some pieces of the puzzle due to their own or their organization‚Äôs blind spots. Sometimes, they hire consultants to help them reason through & communicate about problems, and hopefully bypass blind spots. These consultants can be expensive, hard to hire, and perhaps not needed on a full-time basis. 

SlackGPT (working title, better ideas are welcome) could help with the early problem-solving work, like ideation, and structuring an analysis. It could also help them consume large amounts of information and understand its implications. Finally, it could help them imagine the future and plan accordingly, as well as write up arguments to persuade stakeholders to act on their recommendations. 

Of course, you could just use ChatGPT to answer your business questions. So why SlackGPT? Two reasons: 

1. ChatGPT is a blank slate. This means that you need to give it more than a simple question, to get a good answer out of it. You need to explain to it what you expect from the answer. SlackGPT gives the user a choice of frameworks through which it can analyze a business question. Behind the scenes it does the explaining for you. 
2. ChatGPT lives on it‚Äôs own [webpage](https://chat.openai.com/chat), while most people spend their working time in their usual business tools: email, slides, spreadsheets, chat (Slack anyone?), etc. SlackGPT lives in‚Ä¶ Slack. 

In a nutshell, you will be able to give SlackGPT a question or instruction, choose a framework, and get back a structured answer. Some examples:

- Answer [this question] for me using [scenario analysis]
- Synthesize [this article] for me using [the Pyramid Principle]
- Rewrite [this message] for me to [make it more persuasive]

![vision](/slackgpt_w1/vision.png#center)

This is a work in progress. If you‚Äôre reading this and have some ideas, please share them with me. One thing I know I need to refine is the target audience I wrote about in the beginning. That would also help make the frameworks and use cases more specific. 

# üõ¥**Minimum Viable** **Product**: Current state and what‚Äôs still missing

I‚Äôm currently working on building a prototype or Minimum Viable Product of SlackGPT. 

## Current state

The goal for this week was to get the bot to answer questions through four different frameworks: Cost/Benefit, Pro/Con, Strengths/Weaknesses/Opportunities/Threats and Scenario Analysis. 

To do this, I started by doing some [prompt engineering](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-openai-api), to make sure that when the user asks a question in a given framework, the answer that comes back is meaningful, and is properly structured. I then worked on processing the answers from OpenAI, so that they can consistently be sent to a Slack channel. Finally, I updated the image generating [bot I built in December](http://www.scortescu.com/posts/chatbot/#what-i-learned-by-building-an-ai-powered-chat-bot) with the shiny new question-answering capabilities.  

Here‚Äôs an example of how the bot answers to a scenario analysis for ‚ÄúI decide to write a blog about building my startup‚Äù. 

![prompt](/slackgpt_w1/prompt.png#center)

![prompt_answer](/slackgpt_w1/prompt_answer.png#center)

I‚Äôm expecting three different scenarios: üëçPositive, üëâNeutral and üëéNegative, including possible further developments.

![scenario_1](/slackgpt_w1/scenario_1.png#center)

![scenario_2](/slackgpt_w1/scenario_2.png#center)

![scenario_3](/slackgpt_w1/scenario_3.png#center)


It works! It doesn‚Äôt always work (some questions throw it off), and the quality of the answers can be improved, but it works! For example, in the answer above, the three scenarios should actually be different from each other. There should be a positive, negative and neutral scenario, and each scenario should have a different title. The bot does give positive, negative and neutral scenarios, but the titles are all the same. Also, there could be more variation in the answers. 

## What‚Äôs still missing

There are a ton of things that need to happen before I‚Äôll be able to call this a working prototype:

- Content capabilities:
    - More frameworks, such as:
        - ‚ÄúWork backwards - what Y needs to happen for X to be true‚Äù
        - ‚ÄúWhat are the assumptions behind X‚Äù
        - ‚ÄúWrite a persuasive argument for X‚Äù
        - ‚ÄúRewrite X to be more polite/non-violent/customer friendly‚Äù
- Better answer quality
- Add perspectives/profiles - answer all the framework questions from the point of view of a designer/Elon Musk/a dog/[build your own profile]
- User interface improvements:
    - Build a homepage in Slack for the bot, to help users get started and change settings
    - Add modals - a way for users to interact with the bot that gives more guidance than the /slash commands in the pictures above, like how Slack does it for its built in reminder feature, see below
    
    ![modal](/slackgpt_w1/modal.png#center)
    
- A webpage where users can learn about and install the bot
- Getting the bot ready to be installed on other organization‚Äôs workspaces. This includes:
    - User management
    - Extra security
    - A way to charge money
    - A bunch of other things

# üóø**Personal update:** How‚Äôs it going, Stefan?

I‚Äôm feeling super positive after a week of building. The more I build the more ideas and inspiration I get. 

Fully recovered from my cold and on track for my half-marathon training.

I started two new books that I‚Äôm finding very interesting so far: [The House in the Cerulean Sea](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45047384-the-house-in-the-cerulean-sea) and [Don Quixote](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3836.Don_Quixote) 

Finally, I‚Äôm excited to be going to Strasbourg for a long birthday weekend!

# ‚û°Ô∏è**Next steps:** Step nexts

- Keep working on the MVP. The goal for this week is to tune the answers to the frameworks I already built and build out at least 1 and maybe 2 more frameworks
- Come up with a better name than SlackGPT---

Hi and welcome to my wantrepreneurship blog! Quick update this week: I focused on building up new capabilities for SquidGPT, based on learnings from discovery interviews.

# ü¶ë**Updates to SquidGPT**

After talking to around 10 product managers, I prioritized the first few frameworks that fit the following requirements:

- Widely used by product managers across companies
- AI can write content on them from rough inputs
- My interviewees said they have already used or would use AI to help them write this type of content

The frameworks I implemented are:

- **Working backwards** - a press release announcing the product‚Äôs availability, written with the team imagining the product is ready to ship. The audience is the customer.
- **User stories** - general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user or customer
- **Product brief** - summarizes the scope, goals, and direction of a product. The audience is engineers, designers, direct product stakeholders
- **Go-to-market documents** - translates the product brief to other parts of the organization (e.g. sales, support), and adds plans and strategies relevant to those parts

Here‚Äôs an example output for the **Working backwards** framework, for the following product: ‚Äú**An AI therapy app that can channel various types of therapy depending on the best fit for the patient‚Äù**

![wb](/slackgpt_w10/wb.png#center)

Aside from this, with Antler starting on April 17, I‚Äôm preparing for submitting the app to the Slack marketplace, which means I‚Äôm writing the copy and updating the landing page. However, I‚Äôm afraid I won‚Äôt be able to finish all the things needed to get the app approved. Also, I‚Äôm reluctant to put the app up without a free-trial + paywall. If it turns out to be super popular, I might run into unplanned running costs and be forced to turn it off. 

# ****üóøPersonal update:¬†How‚Äôs it going, Stefan?****

Had a friend visiting this weekend, so we visited the Pompidou museum. I‚Äôm now a big fan of Andy Warhol and Jackson Pollock üòä

New friend visiting the coming weekend, hoping to go on a hike south of Paris this time. 

# ‚û°Ô∏èNext steps

- Update the landing page and tick some (all?) boxes required for the Slack marketplace approval
- Do some more introspection in preparation for Antler---

Hi and welcome to my weekly update, where I write about the day-to-day of my attempt at entrepreneurship. [Last week](http://www.scortescu.com/posts/slackgpt_w1/) I wrote about my vision for the Slack app that I‚Äôm building, and what needs to get done on the way to a working prototype. In this post I share some updates on said prototype.  

# üõ¥Road to a working prototype

This week, I‚Äôve been focused on two things: **improving results from GPT** and **building a running slack app** with slash commands and shortcuts. In terms of the day-to-day, this involved hitting new technical walls, bugs and things I‚Äôve never done before followed by reading lots of documentation and Stackoverflow  posts, and most of all trying stuff. 

## Improving results from GPT

SlackGPT can currently answer questions through four different frameworks: Cost/Benefit, Pro/Con, Strengths/Weaknesses/Opportunities/Threats and Scenario Analysis. Currently, this works *sometimes*. *Sometimes* it doesn‚Äôt finish writing the answer completely. *Sometimes* it writes out something trivial like ‚Äúexpanding to new markets is great because it leads to expanding the company‚Äù. And *sometimes* it can‚Ä¶ become confused üòñ 

![bla.png](/slackgpt_w2/bla.png#center)

I‚Äôm using a few tools to tune the outputs from GPT:

- **Prompt engineering**: Writing better questions to ask the AI has helped me get more consistent results. This includes asking the model to follow a sequence of steps when generating its analyses and asking it to think critically.
- **Model parameters:**
    - **Temperature**: This is a parameter that makes the bot choose more or less improbable answers. Higher temperature means more randomness and potentially more creativity.
    - **Repetition penalties:** Sometimes the model tends to repeat itself. There are some parameters to help prevent this. However, setting these too high leads to inconsistent formatting. That prevents proper postprocessing of results.

Currently, after trying many different combinations, the improvement in answer quality doesn‚Äôt feel stellar. However, it looks like I‚Äôll just have to keep trying if I want a consistently good experience. Otherwise the product won‚Äôt work. 

## **Building a running slack app**

Last week, I already had a running slack app with slash commands. Slash commands are a way to call a slack bot from the text input field.

![slash.png](/slackgpt_w2/slash.png#center)

However, one of the things that SlackGPT wants to do well, is to make it as easy as possible to get good answers out of AI. Writing out a slash command means one needs to remember a command for each framework, or specify the framework within the prompt. Neither of those is very user-friendly. 

So I‚Äôve been working on implementing modals in the app. A user can now click on the ‚ÄúShortcuts‚Äù button and chose to Create an analysis.

![shortcut.png](/slackgpt_w2/shortcut.png#center)

They can then select a framework (work in progress), choose where to get the answer and write out their questions, all in a dedicated modal.

![modal.png](/slackgpt_w2/modal.png#center)

## What‚Äôs still missing

After working on SlackGPT for 2 weeks now, it feels like I should soon have something that others can try. Therefore, I‚Äôm setting myself a deadline to publish the bot by the end of February. In my previous post I‚Äôve mentioned that [what](http://www.scortescu.com/posts/slackgpt_w1/#whats-still-missing) needs to happen for me to call it a working prototype. 

To make it for the 28.02 deadline, I will deprioritize adding more frameworks, adding context, implementing billing and security. That means that the next 2 weeks, I‚Äôll:

- Improve answer quality
- Build a homepage for the bot in Slack
- Build a landing page including an install button
- Handle user management

It‚Äôs an optimistic timeline, but I feel like the need for better execution momentum! 

Once published, I‚Äôll start working on marketing and sales, including: writing more publicly (Twitter and LinkedIn), reaching out to potential customers. 

# üóø**Personal update:¬†How‚Äôs it going, Stefan?**

The long weekend in Strasbourg was awesome! It was great to be surrounded by caring people. Also got to make some chicken BBQ which ended up tasting fantastic.  

Marathon training going well. Now trying to improve the pace to better than 5:30 min/km

Finally, despite light frustration with code bugs and slow progress on answer quality, I feel great about this project! It‚Äôs only been two weeks, but I feel like I‚Äôve learned so much! In particular, I can see a close future where I‚Äôve built a reusable Slack app skeleton. That would make building any future apps faster and easier.

Hi and welcome to my weekly update! I‚Äôve spent the past 3 weeks working on a Slack bot that answers business questions according to pre-defined frameworks - SlackGPT. A minimum-viable version of  SlackGPT is in progress. That includes a *working* bot that users can install onto their own Slack workspace and interact with from multiple touchpoints + a landing page. My self-imposed deadline (*see random thought below*) for this version is 28.02.23. 

> _Random thought: Have you ever wondered what happens when you miss a deadline? Nothing  happens, really. It‚Äôs not like you need to figure out the orbit transfer equation on time, or you‚Äôll miss the connection to Mars. But they help make stuff happen. Deadlines cast shame on the deadline-missers, and people avoid shame at all costs. This is very‚Ä¶ stick. We should have more deadline carrots. Good things should happen when you don‚Äôt miss a deadline._
> 

# **üõ¥Road to a working prototype**

So what needs to happen before 28.02.23. There are four main deliverables:

- ‚úÖImprove answer quality
- ‚úÖBuild a homepage for the bot in Slack
- ‚û°Ô∏èBuild a landing page including an install button
- ‚û°Ô∏èHandle user management

## ‚úÖImproved answer quality

I was getting inconsistent insightfulness and formatting across questions. So I took a systematic approach to fix that. 

1. I defined 15 questions (personal, business & practical) to test with each framework
2. For each framework, I iteratively :
    a. Adjusted the prompts 
    b. Tuned the parameters (see [previous post](http://www.scortescu.com/posts/slackgpt_w2/#improving-results-from-gpt))
3. Fixed the final post-processing code

Interestingly, each prompt works better with different parameters, which makes it non-trivial to get reach an optimal point.  

Now, all prompts work all of the time, and answers tend to be insightful and well written. Here‚Äôs an example of a *negative scenario* for me deciding to learn software engineering while building my first software product

![bad](/slackgpt_w3/bad.png#center)

## ‚úÖBuild a homepage for the bot in Slack

A *homepage* is one of the multiple ‚Äúsurfaces‚Äù a bot can have within Slack. Along with *slash commands* and *shortcuts* it‚Äôs an entry point into the bot. While *slash commands* and *shortcuts* can be accessed anywhere from the text box, the bot homepage is like a user profile, but for a bot. It can also host text and media, which can help guide users the first few times they use the bot. 

![homepage](/slackgpt_w3/homepage.png#center)

Clicking on one of the buttons in the screenshot above opens the following modal:

![home_modal](/slackgpt_w3/home_modal.png#center)

Some ideas for future improvements include:

1. Add a tutorial for how to use the bot
2. Add the possibility to create profiles and context (e.g. write an answer relevant for the Customer Support department of a medium-sized French company)

## ‚û°Ô∏èBuild a landing page including an install button

A landing page, or website, provides a way to communicate about SlackGPT with potential users, and (for now) the only way to install the app. If you‚Äôre selling anything on the internet, and you don‚Äôt have a website, who even are you. 

### Landing page

Bad news: [slackgpt.com](http://slackgpt.com) and [slackgpt.app](http://slackgpt.app) have already been bought up in December.

![ohno](/slackgpt_w3/ohno.png#center)

Good news: I have a bit of progress into building the homepage: 

- Selected a tool: I‚Äôll build the site with [carrd](https://carrd.co/) - it‚Äôs super simple to set up and cheap.
- Found a few examples to guide design: from my past research into slack apps, 2 have stood out with simple, appealing design and copy - [Kona](https://www.heykona.com/) and [HeyTaco](https://heytaco.com/)
- Defined the page structure:
    - Headline + subheadline + call-to-action
    - How it works + screenshots
    - Available frameworks
    - ‚Äúcoming soon ‚Äù features (e.g. message writing, summarization, etc.)

The challenge here will be to write super-clear attractive copy, make some visually pleasing designs without putting weeks of iteration.

### Install button

Really the most important action a user can take on the landing page is to install SlackGPT. There are two ways that an app can be installed into a Slack workplace:

1. Through the official Slack app [marketplace](https://slack.com/apps)
2. Through an unofficial link provided by Slack. This link goes on the landing page.

The approval process for 1 can take up to a a few months, and honestly SlackGPT is not there yet. But anyone can generate their unofficial install link. For SlackGPT, there‚Äôs still one thing to build before that: a way to handle user management.  

## ‚û°Ô∏èHandle user management

Once people start installing the app, the bot will need to know who those people are and how (much) they use it. This will come handy in the future, if our bot aspires to remember things like users‚Äô preferences, whether their free trial is over and whether they‚Äôve subscribed already ü§ë.  

Haven‚Äôt explored this part so far, but aren‚Äôt you super excited to read about it the next post?

# ****üóøPersonal update:¬†How‚Äôs it going, Stefan?****

Marathon training going great. Set a few personal records this week, with longest distance (19.5km), fastest 1km (4.8 min/km), fastest 5km (5.4 min/km)

More and more excited every day about the AI + Slack space. Partly because of the dopamine hits I get from learning things and solving problems + instant feedback. Partly because of some rabbit holes I‚Äôve gone down on all kinds of new tools that will help make SlackGPT awesome.

date: 2023-03-01T13:41:35+01:00
draft: false

Hi and welcome to this week‚Äôs update! It‚Äôs been a month since I‚Äôm working on SquidGPT - a Slack bot that answers business questions according to pre-defined frameworks. I was hoping to have a working, installable version of the bot by the end of February. It looks like I‚Äôll be extending that deadline until next week (for now üòÖ) -  turns out user management is more difficult than I thought. 

Also, the bot has a new name - SquidGPT. Because squids are super smart & social. And I‚Äôm building an AI chatbot, so it fits. The bot will stay a squid, but the name may change, as domain names like [squidgpt.com](http://squidgpt.com) and a few others are already taken. 

# **üõ¥Road to a working prototype**

RIP old deadline of 28.02.23. New deadline 08.03.2022. Four main deliverables:

- ‚úÖImprove answer quality - [see previous post](http://www.scortescu.com/posts/slackgpt_w3/#improved-answer-quality)
- ‚úÖBuild a homepage for the bot in Slack - [see previous post](http://www.scortescu.com/posts/slackgpt_w3/#build-a-homepage-for-the-bot-in-slack)
- ‚ö†Ô∏èBuild a landing page including an install button
- ‚õîHandle user management

## ‚ö†Ô∏èLanding page

Good news: I‚Äôve finished a first draft of [SquidGPT‚Äôs landing page](https://squidgpt.app/) (screenshot below for future generations)

Not so good news: the install button doesn‚Äôt work - courtesy of still inexistent user management

![landing](/slackgpt_w4/landing.png#center)

I‚Äôve built the page with [carrd](https://www.notion.so/13-SlackGPT-Week-4-Landing-page-and-user-management-aef4cc2e877d402eb6098f45d826e480), which makes it incredibly easy to produce. The landing page has six main elements:

- **Logo** - I built the logo with [dall-e](https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2), which is an AI for image generation. the prompt I used:`logo without text for a slack bot that answers questions. cartoonish squid minimalistic aesthetic. vector art illustration, made with illustrator, trending on artstation hq, deviantart, vibrant colors, digital art, concept art, logotype design, 8 khd post - processing, smooth, sharp focus`
- **Install button** - click on this to install the bot
- **Headers** - I‚Äôm still working on the right taglines for this bot, but they will only really get better after I talk to customers
- **How it works** - small tutorial showing how easy it is to get something useful out of ü¶ë
- **Features** - currently, that‚Äôs the four frameworks that SquidGPT can answer questions in
- **Pricing** - ü§ëü§ëü§ë

Kind people have already shared some initial feedback which I will get to after finishing user management:

- Improve visuals
    - Replace How-it-works gif with step by step images that match the step-by step text.
    - Improve feature graphics quality (currently too simpl and large). Perhaps add actual results for each framework
    - Smaller fonts
- Make headline more specific - what kind of decisions will be made faster, for whom?
- Make smaller fonts, especially on mobile
- Figure out pricing - Is 1 week trial enough? Is 9$/month too high/low?

## ‚õîHandle user management

I‚Äôve underestimated how technically difficult user management would be. ‚ÄúUser management‚Äù in the context of SlackGPT means being able to let users from any Slack workplace install the bot, and then have the bot respond to them on request. This requires implementing two pieces of software: an authentication flow and a place to store credentials. The authentication flow would take you to a page like the one below.

![auth](/slackgpt_w4/auth.png#center)

When a user clicks ‚ÄúAllow‚Äù, Slack generates a token (like a password of sorts) specific to that user and workspace. I need to store that token somewhere secure. When a user interacts with the bot, the bot can only answer back if it uses the right token.

The good news is that Slack‚Äôs software development kit helps handle the authentication flow + the storing and retrieving of credentials. The bad news is that: 1. This only works with certain types of databases (e.g. PostgreSQL and SQLite3); and 2. I‚Äôm having a hard time getting these databases (currently using a managed PostgreSQL database from AWS) to talk to my app.

I have a three possible solutions in mind, so there‚Äôs hope:

- Switch to a different *database* provider (e.g. Supabase) - their PostgreSQL implementation seems much friendlier than AWS‚Äô
- Switch to a different *app host* & *database* provider (e.g. Heroku) - there are some tutorials for Heroku serverless functions + databases for Slack bots. Not my favorite option, as I‚Äôve got my app setup working with AWS Lambda
- *Handle authentication by myself*, instead of using Slack‚Äôs library - worst option as it involves rewriting large chunks of the bot + a bunch of code for the authentication flow and database stuff

## ****üóøPersonal update:¬†How‚Äôs it going, Stefan?****

Marathon training: taking an 8-day break from running, to be in full force on March 5th for the Paris semi-marathon 

Excited to have an old friend from university visiting me this weekend. Spring promises to be interesting, with at least 3 other visits planned by May.  

Also feeling kind of anxious & frustrated about missing my end-of-February deadline.

# ‚û°Ô∏èNext steps

For now, I‚Äôm heads down trying to hack my way into an installable bot by setting up user management. Once that‚Äôs done, I‚Äôll start working on and executing a customer development plan, which should be the focus for March

Hi and welcome to this week‚Äôs update! This week I was heads down coding the bot installation and user management. I finished that in good time and spent some time iterating implementing first feedback in SquidGPT‚Äôs website + some minor formatting improvements in the actual app. Finally, today I found out OpenAI is working on their own Slack app (‚ö†Ô∏è) - no surprise there, but still .

# **üõ¥Road to a working prototype**

RIP old deadline of 28.02.23. New deadline 08.03.2022. Four main deliverables:

- ‚úÖImprove answer quality - [see previous post](http://www.scortescu.com/posts/slackgpt_w3/#improved-answer-quality)
- ‚úÖBuild a homepage for the bot in Slack - [see previous post](http://www.scortescu.com/posts/slackgpt_w3/#build-a-homepage-for-the-bot-in-slack)
- ‚úÖBuild a landing page including an install button
- ‚úÖHandle user management üéâ

## ‚úÖLanding page

With installation flows and user management in place, the ‚ÄúAdd to Slack‚Äù button now works!! Go SquidGPT ü¶ë!

I‚Äôve decided to invest some more effort into the landing page beside the install button. My next step is to start talking to potential customers. And I‚Äôve already received some feedback on the landing page. So I went ahead and implemented that. Here are the changes:

- Made the headlines more precise, and hopefully clearer
- Simplified the ‚ÄúHow it works section‚Äù
- Added ‚Äúbusiness-y‚Äù examples for each of the frameworks, and removed the cost benefit framework as it‚Äôs very similar to the pro/con one
- Worked on the visual quality and consistency
- Lowered prices to 2$/user/month
- Added a section on data privacy and security

Here‚Äôs the new page in its full glory (or go to [this link](https://squidgpt.app/) for the real thing):

![landing_v2](/slackgpt_w5/landing_v2.png#center)

## ‚úÖHandle user management

When I finished writing this last week, I was a bit pessimistic about managing to figure this one out. Fortunately, my first idea (*Switch to a different database provider (e.g. Supabase) - their PostgreSQL implementation seems much friendlier than AWS‚Äô*) helped a lot. 

In Supabase, I could see if my database was actually doing anything. With a working database, I found out that the example code provided by Slack had a bug (it didn‚Äôt properly build the require tables, if they didn‚Äôt exist). 

Fixing that bug led me to another one inside Slack‚Äôs Software Development Kit (SDK). Slack‚Äôs own code for handling queries to the database (adding new users, retrieving existing users) didn‚Äôt handle the response correctly. Bad Slack üòµ‚Äçüí´

Everything works now. Hopefully, from here on it should be easier to keep adding features to the bot, and start the process for getting it on the actual [Slack marketplace](https://slack.com/apps)

# ‚ö†Ô∏èOpenAI‚Äôs own Slack bot

[Slack and OpenAI are working together to bring ChatGPT to Slack](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/chatgpt-app-for-slack/) soon. It‚Äôs not unexpected. Microsoft has already integrated ChatGPT in Teams. Hell, everyone and their grandma is doing it. My initial hypothesis that people want to keep chatting where they were chatting and not have to go somewhere new isn‚Äôt the insight of the century. Just try to get someone to install a new messaging up for that one contact (you know who you are).

However, that shouldn‚Äôt change my plans for SquidGPT too much (tell me why it should, *seriously*). I still think (to be confirmed by customers) that getting insightful answers structured according to predefined frameworks is both: 1. useful for people that frequently write up their analyses, and 2. not trivial with ChatGPT‚Äôs current capabilities. 

There‚Äôs one thing that changes. Some people previously asked ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you also add regular ChatGPT, not just the framework stuff?‚Äù. I think that I won‚Äôt be prioritizing that for now. At least until OpenAI reveals more about their plans. 

## ****üóøPersonal update:¬†How‚Äôs it going, Stefan?****

üèÉI‚Äôve finished the half marathon successfully. It was much harder than I first thought - stupid hills. But I still made a good time: 2 hours 1 minute 20 seconds. That‚Äôs 5:45 min/km. With some more prep, I should be able to make the marathon in under 4 hours.

Had a friend visiting over the weekend. It was great to connect and we also went to the Musee d‚ÄôOrsay - always impressed by Monet (naturally, as he‚Äôs an impressionist). 

# ‚û°Ô∏èNext steps

March is the month of customer development. Here‚Äôs what I plan to do:

- Define the customer profile more precisely
- Write up a sequence of messages for reaching out and following up
- Find and write to >100 people
- Run interviews with everyone that responds
- Synthesize the feedback and review the strategy

Hey there, thanks for coming! This week I started customer development efforts. The goal is to talk to people that could benefit from using [SquidGPT](https://squidgpt.app/), and understand what problems it could help them solve. That should translate into improvements and new features in the app, which will turn it into a product people actually find helpful. 

Also, big announcement this week: I got accepted into [Antler](https://www.antler.co/)‚Äôs April Paris cohort. 

Today‚Äôs show:

- üÖ∞Ô∏è**Joining Antler**
- üôã**First customer development efforts**
- üèõÔ∏è**Getting on the Slack app Marketplace**
- ****üóøPersonal update:¬†How‚Äôs it going, Stefan?****
- **‚û°Ô∏èNext steps**

# üÖ∞Ô∏èJoining Antler

[Antler](https://www.antler.co/) is an early stage VC investor that runs a 10-week founder-matching program. By the end of these 10 weeks, I hope to have found a co-founder, developed an idea together and secured a seed investment (ü§û). Exciting!!!

Joining Antler means I would change paths, from [bootstrapped](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bootstrapping.asp) solopreneurship to VC-funded startup. 

**The downside:** 

- Having investors has similar connotations to having a boss
- Having co-founders means sharing ownership, and comes with incompatibility risks

**The upside:** 

- [Leverage](https://fs.blog/leverage/)
    - 1+1= more than 2: Two compatible people working together can achieve more than the sum of what they can achieve alone
    - Investors and peers in the program drastically increase my support network
    - Investors can help open doors: more investors, clients, etc.)
    - The potential to build something bigger and more impactful: instead of leveraging just my time, I would be leveraging invested capital + my time
- It‚Äôs more fun to build something together than alone
- Connecting with amazing people

The program is starting on April 17. Until then, I‚Äôll push SquidGPT as much as possible. In the program, I will most likely explore ideas other than SquidGPT. In case Antler invests, SquidGPT will become a fun side project. If not, I‚Äôll be back at it in July. 

# üôã**First customer development efforts**

Always when starting a new thing, the hardest part is getting over procrastination (for me). The unknown can be scary. Especially when that means reaching out to strangers, asking them for things. However, once I start doing the doing gets easier. 

This week I began reaching out to people to talk about problems SquidGPT could help solve. Here‚Äôs my process: 

1. Define the customer profile
2. Reach out to people that fit the profile
3. Talk to the ones that pick up the (proverbial) phone
4. Synthesize and make ü¶ë better

## 1. Define customer profile

I‚Äôm starting from the hypothesis that people that could benefit most from SquidGPT work in small to medium sized companies, often write slides for their jobs and use Slack. That narrows down the customer profile to:

- Job title (in order of probable relevance)
    - {Business/Biz/Product/Sales/Support/Revenue} + {Operations/Strategy} + {Associate/Manager/Director/Head of/Lead/Owner}
    - Chief of Staff
    - Managing director
    - Founder/CEO
- Company size:
    - 50-500 (big enough to need structured communication, small enough to buy indie slack apps)
- Industries (Took a breakdown of slack users by industry from [G2](https://www.g2.com/products/slack/reviews#reviews)):
    - Computer Software
    - Information Technology and Services
    - Marketing and Advertising
    - Finance

If you found this blog after I reached out, know that there‚Äôs more to this than just a process. I‚Äôm genuinely interested in talking to you and helping you solve your problems. If you happen to fit this profile, please reach out to me

## 2. Reach out to people that fit the profile

Using a templated message can be a bit impersonal, but saves tons of time. Here‚Äôs a message that I‚Äôm currently trying out:

  

```
Hi [],

I noticed that you work []. I'm trying to understand the challenges faced by [] folks, both in general in their day-to-day work and particularly related to ideation and structured communication. 

I'm not looking to sell you anything or pitch my product. Rather, by understanding the problems you face, I hope to develop a helpful solution. 

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to share your insights? You can schedule one at []

Kind regards,

[]
```

## 3. Talk to the ones that pick up the (proverbial) phone

So far I sent 50 connection requests, got 30 connections, had 1 call. While the conversation was interesting, it was hard to get into the details - customer profile was slightly off. For the call, I wrote up an interview guide, but since it‚Äôs shorthand, I won‚Äôt be sharing it here. Happy to share it in private. My learning is that I should build more rapport at the start of the conversation, rather than jumping into the meat right away.

Next, I‚Äôll be reaching out to >250 more and following up on those first messages. At the current rate, that means something like 10 real conversations. 

## 4. Synthesize and make ü¶ë better

Hopefully, I‚Äôll learn about users problems and understand if SquidGPT + improvements can help solve those. Hopefully more on this soon

# üèõÔ∏è**Getting on the Slack app Marketplace**

Since I‚Äôll be joining Antler mid-April, I don‚Äôt want to leave SquidGPT in the vacuum. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm starting to get the app ready to be released on the Slack app Marketplace. 

The things I need to do are mostly writing copy (e.g. short description, long description), covering some bases on security & privacy (privacy policy, implementing some best practices), and adding an onboarding flow to the app. [Alex](https://twitter.com/sashimiblade), maker of [Truffle](https://truffle.bot/) has been super helpful with tips and tricks here. If you need a Slack bot that can answer questions based on your existing Slack conversations - try Truffle. 

While I‚Äôm at it, I‚Äôll try to sneak in a few improvements I already have in mind for SquidGPT: upgrading to ChatGPT (OpenAI released this to the public), adding a persistent context  that can be added to your questions (write once, use anytime), to personalize answers, and some ways to follow up on the questions (e.g. dig deeper, improve answer, More!)

# **üóøPersonal update:¬†How‚Äôs it going, Stefan?**

üóºMore people visiting this weekend. It‚Äôs always nice to walk around Paris with the eyes of a tourist. This time we went to the Louvre - it‚Äôs so big, I got lost a few times. 

ü•ÇThe coming weekend I‚Äôm hosting an end-of-season party with the crew from my improv class!

üèÉAlso, went on an unexpected 15k run - good start for marathon training. As I was going out for my morning 5k, I forgot the keys inside. Had to go pick up the spares. 

# ‚û°Ô∏èNext steps

March is the month of customer development. Here‚Äôs what I plan to do:

- Reach out 250 people/Run >10 customer interviews by end of March.
- Start getting the app ready for submission to the marketplace

Hey you! I‚Äôve been heads down in the customer discovery process, so today I‚Äôll be sharing a quick update on how that‚Äôs going + some stats on you ü•Å

# üôãCustomer discovery progress

Let‚Äôs start this off with some numbers. In the chart below you can see that around 1% (2/161) of cold messages get converted into interviews (ü•≤).

![funnel](/slackgpt_w7/funnel.png#center)

Half of those messages were very lightly personalized, and half of them I personalized more thoroughly, including based on your feedback. Unfortunately that hasn‚Äôt made a difference yet. I‚Äôll be following up with the people that haven‚Äôt replied yet (99%) - hopefully that will help. 

On the other hand 42% (7/17) of warm messages I sent converted into an interview so far, and that number will probably increase (messages went out yesterday). That‚Äôs much better, so I will be doubling down on that. At this rate, I should be reach my interview goal (10) by next week, which will leave me ~2 weeks to make improvements in SquidGPT before joining Antler.  

Of the two interviews I‚Äôve done already, one was super useful. It was with a Product Lead in a tech company, and the main learning from it was that PMs could definitely use help with brainstorming text content within specific frameworks. Now I have two more frameworks that I can potentially add to SquidGPT - hoping to confirm that in my upcoming interviews.

Oh, and something I‚Äôve learned about LinkedIn, was that it‚Äôs not very hard for the platform to label you a spammer. Viewing more than ~80 profiles/company pages in one day can get you there (seems to apply only to people you‚Äôre not connected with). [Here‚Äôs a guide I found](https://phantombuster.com/blog/guides/linkedin-automation-rate-limits-2021-edition-5pFlkXZFjtku79DltwBF0M) on this.

# ü§üYou

This posts marks 4 months of continuous writing, so I thought I‚Äôd share some stats on the visitors of this page (üëÅÔ∏è). 

![ga](/slackgpt_w7/ga.png#center)

Since I enabled tracking at the beginning of January, there were 83 new users coming to the blog. Some users may be coming here from different devices, so cut that number in 2 to be conservative. Some of those users are me (yes, I read my blog sometimes, from multiple devices). 

That‚Äôs about 40 unique visitors, about 15 of which are returning visitors. Not too much, but a lot more than I ever planned on. So‚Ä¶thank you very much for reading!

I plan to keep on writing during the Antler program, but I might need to start doing that on weekends. 

# ****üóøPersonal update:¬†How‚Äôs it going, Stefan?****

ü•ÇIt was awesome to host the improv group at my place on Saturday! If you ever want to do something that meet cool people, grow as a person and have tons of fun, join improv

üé∏Bought a new guitar and started practicing again, after a pause of around 2 years. Love it!

# ‚û°Ô∏èNext steps

Hi and welcome to my weekly blog, where I write about my progress in building a company! I spent the last week mostly talking to people - I‚Äôm starting to get to know the awesome people in my Antler cohort (co-cohorters?), while also doing more discovery interviews. 

# üÖ∞Ô∏èPreparing for the start of the program

The first few weeks of the program are about testing the compatibility waters by getting to know and trying to work with potential cofounders. It‚Äôs like a combination of The Bachelor and Shark Tank. Since a few weeks is not enough to give it a try with every single person, some pre-program speed dating can help surface both good/bad chemistry and common interests/goals.

## Speed dating

As far as I can tell, there are currently 40 people starting the Antler program with me on April 17. My goal is to meet most of them before the program starts. 

So far, the more people I meet, the more excited I get. Everyone has an impressive track record and seems has the hunger to build something awesome. 

As you would expect from someone keen on (obsessed with?) keeping things organized I‚Äôm using a personal CRM, [Clay](https://clay.earth/), to keep track of the people I meet, and take notes. It makes it super convenient that Clay is synced to my calendar and LinkedIn, and can also suggest people to re-connect with. 

## Self reflection

To make this courtship game easier, Antler suggests engaging in some self-reflection, and provides some tools that help out with that. I‚Äôm a big fan of both self-reflection, and meeting new people, so this is exciting!

One of the tools is a slide where people fill in their:

- Operational strengths
- Personality profile (e.g. MBTI)
- Personal values
- Working style

While filling this in, I was surprised to learn that my MBTI profile ([ENTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/entj-personality)) has changed since I last took it around 5 years ago. In particular, I‚Äôve become a lot more extroverted (E), and slightly more intuitive (N) than sensing (S) (concentrating more on big picture & patterns rather than details). 

# üôãCustomer discovery progress

After a few more customer discovery interviews, I‚Äôm starting to get a more well rounded idea of my ideal customer profile and how SquidGPT could help them.

While my initial assumption was that Strategy and Business Operations folks could make best use of a tool like SquidGPT, it looks that Product people could be an even better fit.

Another takeaway from the last few interviews is a more defined set of frameworks that could be useful to Product Managers. I‚Äôm hesitating of sharing the specific frameworks here, before I actually build them into the product, but I‚Äôll be happy to share in private. 

Super excited to research the frameworks suggested by the people I talk to, and find ways to make AI speak those frameworks well. Meanwhile, I have a few more discovery interviews lined up.

# üóøPersonal update:¬†How‚Äôs it going, Stefan?

üî®I spent the weekend in Lille helping my sister- and brother-in-law to build an exhibition stand at a rail industry fair. It felt great to build things with my hands. The cool thing with manual work is that your effort becomes reality instantly, and progress is very visible. 

üèÉStarted working on my marathon training plan. I‚Äôm using a pre-structured program available for my Garmin watch, and ChatGPT to adjust the ramp up in performance targets to match my goals (under 4h).  

üöÖGoing to Strasbourg this weekend - always shocked by the contrast in noise levels and when going there from Paris.

# ‚û°Ô∏èNext steps

- Wrap up this round of customer discovery interviews
- Research the frameworks suggested by interviewees and add them to the bot
- Meeting more Antler people

Hey there! Welcome to my blog, where I write about my entrepreneurial journey. Last week I spent most of my time meeting (>20) people from my Antler cohort, doing a few more discovery interviews and starting to research the insights coming out of these interviews. 

# üÖ∞Ô∏èPreparing for the start of the program

I‚Äôve been meeting more and more potential co-founders last week, and I‚Äôm getting more and more excited to build something with one or more of them. Genuinely impressed with the high caliber of people that Antler selected for the program. There‚Äôs a wide diversity of demographics (age, origin, but less so gender) and experiences (AI, consulting, product management, research, large corporates). Many of the people I met are passionate about topics such as climate, health (including mental) and of course AI, and a few are serial entrepreneurs.

The topic that speaks loudest to me is helping people improve their mental health, and I think AI-powered solutions can have a huge impact in this space. I‚Äôm staying open to other areas, but mental health + AI will probably be top-of-mind. 

The chats I‚Äôm having with potential co-founders to start out as your typical job interview, where we each share our professional stories, sprinkled with some personal stuff. A big difference however is that there‚Äôs much more ‚Äúreal‚Äù sharing and vulnerability from the start. It becomes a lot less about trying to make the best impression, and a lot more about authenticity. 

Interestingly, I‚Äôm getting more attuned to measuring the chemistry and the ease with each we understand each other. I‚Äôm also noticing that I‚Äôm paying a lot of attention to how specific vs. general people are in their examples and the balance between solid vision and open-mindedness. 

Finally, today there‚Äôs a kick-off event, where we‚Äôll be meeting in person for the first timeüéâ

# üôãCustomer discovery progress

With the focus gradually shifting to antler, it‚Äôs becoming difficult to build up momentum in building SquidGPT further beyond doing the customer interviews. I still hope to squeeze in building some features before Antler starts, but time is moving so fast üòÖ

After a few more discovery chats, I‚Äôve narrowed down the top 4 frameworks frameworks I‚Äôll be adding to SquidGPT next:

- **Working backwards** - a press release announcing the product‚Äôs availability, written with the team imagining the product is ready to ship. The audience is the customer.
- **User stories** - general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user or customer
- **Product brief** - summarizes the scope, goals, and direction of a product. The audience is engineers, designers, direct product stakeholders
- **Go-to-market documents** - translates the product brief to other parts of the organization (e.g. sales, support), and adds plans and strategies relevant to those parts

The discussions have fleshed out a few other learnings, that go against the hypotheses I‚Äôm basing SquidGPT on:

- PMs may not want to delegate work that‚Äôs highly strategic and creative (e.g. product strategy) to AI tools. Instead, high volume and less creative (e.g. synthesizing large amounts of information into a work product, properly tagging and analyzing tickets in Jira) could be a better fit
- People may not really need help with starting to write something, but rather with polishing and covering blind spots
- Users may be reluctant to share strategic or quantitative information due to privacy concerns
- Users may want help with picking the right framework for a problem rather than with filling it in

# üóøPersonal update:¬†How‚Äôs it going, Stefan?

This weekend I went to see a theater play by a Moldovan theater company in Strasbourg. It was a bit too much of an abstract-variety-show-manifesto-type-of-play for me to enjoy it, but it‚Äôs cool to see Moldovan artists on Western European scenes. I‚Äôve also stuffed my mouth with as much tarte flambee as I could!

A friend is visiting this weekend. Looking forward to catching up and visiting the Louvre for the second time this month. 

# ‚û°Ô∏èNext steps

- Add new frameworks to bot
- Meet more people from my Antler cohort
