Hey you! I’ve been heads down in the customer discovery process, so today I’ll be sharing a quick update on how that’s going + some stats on you 🥁

## Customer discovery progress

Let’s start this off with some numbers. In the chart below you can see that around 1% (2/161) of cold messages get converted into interviews (🥲).

Half of those messages were very lightly personalized, and half of them I personalized more thoroughly, including based on your feedback. Unfortunately that hasn’t made a difference yet. I’ll be following up with the people that haven’t replied yet (99%) - hopefully that will help. 

On the other hand 42% (7/17) of warm messages I sent converted into an interview so far, and that number will probably increase (messages went out yesterday). That’s much better, so I will be doubling down on that. At this rate, I should be reach my interview goal (10) by next week, which will leave me ~2 weeks to make improvements in SquidGPT before joining Antler.  

Of the two interviews I’ve done already, one was super useful. It was with a Product Lead in a tech company, and the main learning from it was that PMs could definitely use help with brainstorming text content within specific frameworks. Now I have two more frameworks that I can potentially add to SquidGPT - hoping to confirm that in my upcoming interviews.

Oh, and something I’ve learned about LinkedIn, was that it’s not very hard for the platform to label you a spammer. Viewing more than ~80 profiles/company pages in one day can get you there (seems to apply only to people you’re not connected with). [Here’s a guide I found](https://phantombuster.com/blog/guides/linkedin-automation-rate-limits-2021-edition-5pFlkXZFjtku79DltwBF0M) on this.

# You

This posts marks 4 months of continuous writing, so I thought I’d share some stats on the visitors of this page (👁️). 

![ga](/slackgpt_w7/ga.png#center)

Since I enabled tracking at the beginning of January, there were 83 new users coming to the blog. Some users may be coming here from different devices, so cut that number in 2 to be conservative. Some of those users are me (yes, I read my blog sometimes, from multiple devices). 

That’s about 40 unique visitors, about 15 of which are returning visitors. Not too much, but a lot more than I ever planned on. So…thank you very much for reading!

I plan to keep on writing during the Antler program, but I might need to start doing that on weekends. 

# ****🗿Personal update: How’s it going, Stefan?****

🥂It was awesome to host the improv group at my place on Saturday! If you ever want to do something that meet cool people, grow as a person and have tons of fun, join improv 

🚆This weekend I’ll be visiting Lille

🎸Bought a new guitar and started practicing again, after a pause of around 2 years. Love it!

# ➡️Next steps

March is the month of customer development. Here’s what I plan to do:

- Write to more people in my network and run >10 customer interviews by end of next week
- Synthesize interview feedback and plan improvements in SquidGPT
