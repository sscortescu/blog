My main goal for 2024 was to reach ramen profitability with TypeCharm. The odds are against me. Most startups fail in the 1st 2 years. Time to revenue can (did!) stretch beyond the initial rush of optimism and willpower.

How to trick my brain to put in the effort for its own sake, suspending judgement? What could I do that pushed my performance to the limit, with more certainty for a pay off?

Run a marathon! I love running, and even though running a marathon is hard, the vast majority of marathon starters are marathon finishers.

👉 What did I learn?

1. Hard work does pay off, but later.

My marathon time improved from 4:45 hours (October ‘23) to 4:16 hours. I aimed for 4 hours both times, so hoping that 3rd time’s the charm.

Six months after the idea of TypeCharm, it had its first revenue. This is still a long way from ramen-profitable, and more than a year since my first entrepreneurial project.

2. It’s easier in a community:

Friends inspired me to run a marathon, and then supported me both in prep and in cheering during the race.

As an expat entrepreneur, I'm grateful for the Antler and Hook ecosystems - a vibrant source of inspiration, motivation and support.

3. Just don’t die:

The key to finishing the marathon was to keep going.

Towards the end, what kept me going was awareness of my balance of energy, pain and pleasure: Did I still have gas in the tank? Can I bear the pain for a little longer? Do I still want that picture with the medal?
