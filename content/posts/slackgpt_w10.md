Hi and welcome to my wantrepreneurship blog! Quick update this week: I focused on building up new capabilities for SquidGPT, based on learnings from discovery interviews.

# 🦑**Updates to SquidGPT**

After talking to around 10 product managers, I prioritized the first few frameworks that fit the following requirements:

- Widely used by product managers across companies
- AI can write content on them from rough inputs
- My interviewees said they have already used or would use AI to help them write this type of content

The frameworks I implemented are:

- **Working backwards** - a press release announcing the product’s availability, written with the team imagining the product is ready to ship. The audience is the customer.
- **User stories** - general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user or customer
- **Product brief** - summarizes the scope, goals, and direction of a product. The audience is engineers, designers, direct product stakeholders
- **Go-to-market documents** - translates the product brief to other parts of the organization (e.g. sales, support), and adds plans and strategies relevant to those parts

Here’s an example output for the **Working backwards** framework, for the following product: “**An AI therapy app that can channel various types of therapy depending on the best fit for the patient”**

Aside from this, with Antler starting on April 17, I’m preparing for submitting the app to the Slack marketplace, which means I’m writing the copy and updating the landing page. However, I’m afraid I won’t be able to finish all the things needed to get the app approved. Also, I’m reluctant to put the app up without a free-trial + paywall. If it turns out to be super popular, I might run into unplanned running costs and be forced to turn it off. 

# ****🗿Personal update: How’s it going, Stefan?****

Had a friend visiting this weekend, so we visited the Pompidou museum. I’m now a big fan of Andy Warhol and Jackson Pollock 😊

New friend visiting the coming weekend, hoping to go on a hike south of Paris this time. 

# ➡️Next steps

- Update the landing page and tick some (all?) boxes required for the Slack marketplace approval
- Do some more introspection in preparation for Antler
