Hi, and welcome to my building-in-public blog. This week’s update is a short one. I wasted too much time reading articles and too little time documenting research. Also got a cold. 

### **➡️** Last week, I said I’ll be working on:

1. Find potential customers and talk to them, starting with people managers and HR professionals in my network —> *Will start preparing questions in the coming weeks, but will only reach out once the year ends,* *as I doubt I’ll get many responses before that. Hopefully, understanding existing products should make for better questions.*
2. Build an MVP. TBD how functional it’s going to be (could be some mockups, a landing page, an actual add-on with basic functionality). The idea is to have something people can react to —> *Will probably work on this in January/February.* 
3. Understand existing solutions, and what could be a unique angle of attack —> *quick update below, as this is work in progress*

## 🤔Competitive analysis

### What am I trying to understand by looking at the competition?

- What are the unique things that make each competitor attractive?
- What are common pain points with competitor’s products?
- How could I find a unique angle of attack?
    - In which parts of employee engagement (1-on-1s, recognition, feedback, performance reviews, pulse surveys) could there be an opportunity to do something differently, and better?

### After looking at 8 competitors in detail, here are my very rough hypotheses:

- Most existing solutions seem robotic, life-less. There’s an opportunity to make engagement tools more fun.
- Smaller companies (e.g. <200) want to do feedback, but current solutions are too-process focused
- Most solutions offer some analytics, but none (few?) seem to frame them for discussion (i.e. here’s a ready-made slide on the team pulse that you can use in the all-hands)
- Engagement surveys and recognition apps (e.g. kudos/high five/etc.) seem like the easiest to build but also most overdone/overcrowded spaces

## ➡️Next steps

- Analyze ~40 more players in the space
- Start framing questions for user interviews
