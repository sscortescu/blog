Hi there! Thanks for coming to my blog where I write about my entrepreneurial journey! I‚Äôm writing this from a train going to Le Havre. Somehow it feels like I‚Äôm sending a postcard into the ether. 

This post*card* is the second in a series I will be writing while participating in the Antler program. The 1st post is [here](http://www.scortescu.com/posts/antler_w1/). 

The first week of Antler was intense, but the second week even more so. Almost every day, when the office would close, we‚Äôd go for dinner and drinks and more socializing. What‚Äôs awesome about this is that besides finding a team, there‚Äôs a lot of friendship potential. On the other hand, it must be draining for introverts. 

I spent less time in presentations and more time in group projects (team challenges). The project topics and teams were different every day, which helped test out waters with a few more people. With so little time to do something meaningful, the topics are really just an excuse to show your working style and way of thinking, and check the fit with other people.

However, the last project was quite exciting in itself - a hustle challenge. The goal was to get as much traction as possible in a 2-3 days. A company can show traction in different ways ranging from ‚Äúsure thing‚Äù (e.g. revenue) to ‚Äúbasically nothing‚Äù (e.g. statement of intent, waiting list signups). 

The feeling of working on this was quite unique. With our team, we decided to go for cash - more difficult but also more real. Our idea was to go door-to-door selling review QR codes to restaurants. With more than 80% of customers using Google Maps to find businesses, it‚Äôs shocking how many businesses still don‚Äôt ask their customers for reviews. We actually sold the one below, along with a few others.

Finally, the big achievement of the week is that I started discussing more seriously with two potential cofounders. We‚Äôre talking about our values, the skills and experience we bring to the table and what we could build together. With some teams already tracking out (Antler speak for getting engagedüíç), there‚Äôs some FOMO. 

It‚Äôs a fine line to walk between trying to form a team as soon as possible (also because others are doing it, so the supply of cofounders is shrinking), and taking the time you need to be sure you want to give it a try with someone. Tracking out is a formal process. It shows a higher level of commitment and that you discussed some compatibility basics. In exchange, Antler provides a higher level of support and access.
