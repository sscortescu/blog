Hi and thanks for coming by! Short update this week.

In my last post, I finished with a list of ways to find micro-Saas ideas, that I planned to use.   

So, for the past week-and-a-bit, I was trying find inspiration in SaaS idea newsletters (one of the ways‚Ä¶). This produced some moderate results, here‚Äôs a dump of ideas:

```
Idea dump
* Taxfix for solopreneurs
* Bubble plugin that takes webform data to google sheets
* Linktree-style website builder for doctors and other independent practitioners, 
including appointment booking, payments, loyalty. If Doctolib is Amazon, this is Shopify
* Invoice generator from Notion/Coda
* Some CMS ideas:
** Knowledgebase that uses Airtable/Coda to manage it's content
** Use Airtable/Notion/Coda to manage content in Wordpress/Wix/Webflow or other website builders
** Airtable/Notion/Coda to manage a simple productroadmap page, including feature upvote
* Subscription flow/billing plugin for Wordpress/Wix/Webflow
* Competitor comparison page generator based on G2/Capterra data
* Manage (write, schedule, analytics) linkedin posts from notion/coda/airtable
* [Shopify plugin] Scan QR code to take cart to mobile device and continue shopping 
```

Another way to find ideas that I‚Äôve read about and thought attractive, is to find popular apps on one platform (e.g. Shopify) and try to build it on a competitor‚Äôs platform (e.g. Woocommerce). So i found a [list of platforms that have app marketplaces](https://rocketgems.com/blog/saas-marketplaces/). To better understand if these platforms are a good fit, I looked at 3 things: size, growth and whether they have documentation for building with Python (the programming language I‚Äôm least of a noob in). I also filtered out any platform that I know nothing about. 

The top 10 biggest platforms from this list are:

1. Zoom
2. G Suite/Google Workspace
3. Shopify
4. Wix
5. Slack
6. Salesforce
7. Figma
8. Wordpress
9. Stripe
10. Coda

The top 10 fastest growing platforms are:

1. Hubspot
2. JotForm
3. Figma
4. Airtable
5. Magento
6. Webflow
7. Monday
8. Typeform
9. Salesforce
10. Zendesk

So I went through the documentation of each of these platforms, and it looks like only **Slack** enables building using Python - for the rest, I‚Äôd need to learn JavaScript üòß. Some other platforms (e.g. Stripe) enable building things with Python, but not for apps on their marketplaces (which makes it harder to find a distribution channel for the app). 

# **How‚Äôs it going, Stefan**

With a few more and diverse ideas, I feel more positive. However, I‚Äôm kind of bummed that Slack is the only platform I can start building on without starting to learn from scratch.  

# **‚û°Ô∏èNext steps**

Keep brainstorming. Next, I‚Äôll try to find apps that work well on one platform but aren‚Äôt on a competitive platform yet.
