It’s the opposite of building in stealth.\nThe kind of stuff people share varies (see lists of examples here and here).

Every good thing has three reasons to back it up (aka, what is this solving?):\nAccountability: Working in an organization naturally gives you some structure: checking in with your boss, meeting deadlines, producing output that someone else needs as input. All this creates accountability that is missing when you go at it alone. Committing to share progress publicly is one way to create this kind of accountability, at least before customers Clarify thinking: Writing forces you to examine your thoughts from a distance. It’s easier to think about your thinking when you can read about it. When someone else might read these thoughts, the pressure is on to explain things clearly. (OK, bear with me, if this whole thing isn’t clear, I’m just starting 😅) Get feedback. No need to explain this one. Please share your feedback. Bonus reason: One thing that helped me build up the courage to start something is reading about what \u0026 how others are building. Hopefully, what I write will pass some inspirations and learnings up the karma chain. Sharing is caring 💓.\nMy approach to building in public What and when: It’s simple. I plan to share weekly updates on my progress. The first (this) update is on Building in public and Idea generation. The next few updates will be on problems I am exploring and how to decide on which problem to solve.\nHow and where: This blog is made using the paper-mod Hugo blog template and hosted on github pages. I’m using this as an opportunity for learning to hack together a website.\nAs I become less of a chicken, I might share these on twitter and linkedin.\nOnce I have more real stuff to show, I’ll join a builder community as well, to further solve for accountability, clearer thinking and feedback. Some examples are Pioneer, Megamaker, Makerlog, YC startupschool, Indie worldwide\n💡Generating startup ideas I’m starting out by making what the collective entrepreneurship wisdom of the internet says is a mistake 😱. I don’t have a clear idea of what to build yet. So I’m relying on what I know best: doing research, using that to structure an approach, then following that approach and iterating as I learn.\nThere are a few pieces of good advice on how to generate startup ideas. My key learning (and also one of the core principles of design thinking) is that success requires building a solution to an existing problem, rather than building a solution then finding a problem it can solve.\nSo the plan I came up with to generate ideas (find problems?) is:\nOil up my idea machine by brainstorming daily based on prompts Inspired by this article from James Altucher I found/made a bunch of prompts (notion kanban here) based on the following articles How to Get Startup Ideas : YC Startup Library | Y Combinator 12 Frameworks for Finding Startup Ideas — Advice for Future Founders How to generate better ideas Find some common promising themes between the ideas that keep coming up Do deeper research on the above, guided by the following questions: What are people complaining/asking about on the internet (reddit, quora, etc.)? This article has a promising approach: The Ultimate Guide to Unbundling Reddit What problems are people using spreadsheets to solve? I’ve been living in spreadsheets for the past few years… What problems do large businesses routinely spend a lot to solve (i.e. expensive legacy solutions, large teams)?

<p>I’m starting out by making what the collective entrepreneurship wisdom of the internet says is a mistake 😱. I don’t have a clear idea of what to build yet. So I’m relying on what I know best: doing research, using that to structure an approach, then following that approach and iterating as I learn.</p>
<p>There are a few pieces of good advice on how to generate startup ideas. My key learning (and also one of the core principles of design thinking) is that success requires building a solution to an existing problem, rather than building a solution then finding a problem it can solve.</p>
<p>So the plan I came up with to generate ideas (find problems?) is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Oil up my idea machine by brainstorming daily based on prompts
<ul>
<li>Inspired by <a href="https://jamesaltucher.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-for-becoming-an-idea-machine/">this article</a> from James Altucher</li>
<li>I found/made a bunch of prompts (notion kanban <a href="https://www.notion.so/Brainstorming-prompts-874629599beb483fbbc4d41c735d681f">here</a>) based on the following articles

<li><a href="https://jakobgreenfeld.com/better-ideas">How to generate better ideas</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Find some common promising themes between the ideas that keep coming up</li>
<li>Do deeper research on the above, guided by the following questions:
<ul>
<li>What are people complaining/asking about on the internet (reddit, quora, etc.)? <em>This article has a promising approach: <a href="https://latecheckout.substack.com/p/the-ultimate-guide-to-unbundling">The Ultimate Guide to Unbundling Reddit</a></em></li>
<li>What problems are people using spreadsheets to solve? <em><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>I’ve been living in spreadsheets for the past few years…</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></em></li>
