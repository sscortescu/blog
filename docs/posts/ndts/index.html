Took me one day to do it, but it was great learning and feels great to have an actual work product\n‚úÖ Write about my approach to validation\nüëÅÔ∏è Promising themes To find some common threads, I went to my brainstorming notes and reflected back on conversations with friends. I keep going back to the following topics: team/employee experience \u0026 engagement, mental health, collaboration \u0026 productivity, artificial intelligence.\nMy evidence for the below is anecdotal. That means they are starting hypotheses, to be refined.\nTeam/employee experience \u0026 engagement I‚Äôve been an long time complainer about managers, company dynamics, team dynamics and so on. In a team, when things go well, there‚Äôs little incentive to reflect, be vulnerable (to get to the root of issues) or do much more than ‚Äújob tasks‚Äù. However, things aren‚Äôt always going as well as it seems on the surface.\nRemote work took away a lot of the self-regulation mechanisms that being in the same room or building provide. Some examples that come to mind: guessing how your team mate feels when you see them in the coffee room; learning \u0026 adapting to someone‚Äôs style by working next to each other. We flatten people down into Slack handles, email addresses and blurry faces in conference calls. I‚Äôm not surprised that people keep leaving their jobs, and one of the big reasons for this they don‚Äôt feel leaders and colleagues care for them or their growth (McKinsey).\nThe problem: In a distributed work environment, growing and maintaining employee experience \u0026 engagement requires tools that most managers are not equipped with, and structure that most teams can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt build on their own.\nMental health I‚Äôve also been a long time mental health enthusiast. Coming from a curiosity about how people think \u0026 feel, my own struggles with depression, anxiety \u0026 relationships, and a constant need to understand analyze, it‚Äôs hard for me not to ideate on mental health topics. Also, I‚Äôm crazy ü§™.\nTwo problems:\nAccess to mental health care in Europe is difficult enough, because there are not enough practitioners, and getting insurers to cover expenses is difficult if not impossible. Even when insurers will pay, they‚Äôll only do it for practitioners licensed in the country you live in. That makes it almost impossible for expats to get care. Most mental health workers don‚Äôt (have time to?) treat their practice as a real business, aside from the bare minimal. There seems to be room to professionalize the operations behind e.g. therapists practices. Think scheduling, customer relationship management, billing, record keeping, etc. Collaboration \u0026 productivity If collaboration and productivity solutions were an animal, I think they would be an ant üêú. There are too many of them, they divide labor to solve complex problems, and each individual ant is totally replaceable, except the queen (MS Excel in this metaphor).\nTwo productivity/collaboration problems I‚Äôve encountered over and over:\nFollowing up on people for things is frustrating, necessary and easy to let slip through the cracks. I‚Äôve come across this every time I needed someone else‚Äôs output on a deadline (especially when they have a different boss), and found myself writing those cringe ‚ÄúJust following up on this..‚Äù mails/slacks. Companies make decisions all the time, but with endless meetings and debates, many seem to get lost. Sometimes these are important decisions that end up being a company‚Äôs strategy. I have yet to see decisions being documented and communicated through something more than email and slides. ‚ùîWhat to focus on Team/employee experience \u0026 engagement is really the topic that I can‚Äôt stop thinking about at the moment. I‚Äôve spent much of the past week reading about existing companies in the space, and keep thinking ‚ÄúI wish I had built this‚Äù. Some companies that seem to have made it in this space are CultureAmp, Leapsome, Lattice and 15Five (used and loved this one in a previous job). There are many others.\nThere is a set of behaviors and tools that I learned in consulting, that I think helps improve engagement, and that I don‚Äôt think is used (well) enough in most companies. The companies I mentioned above tackle at least one of:\nRegularly taking the team‚Äôs pulse, learning how they feel about things that matter to them, talking about it and making changes Having structured 1-on-1 conversations, both on harder (content, work process) and softer (relationship, wellbeing) topics Getting and giving (frequent) Appreciation Actionable feedback Explicitly learning about each other‚Äôs working \u0026 communication styles, routines, preferences, strengths and aspirations Structuring a proper onboarding and offboarding for new hires and exits both at company and team level Aside from my passion for these problems and how excited I get about these tools, here are a three other reasons why I plan to further explore this topic:\nSome of the issues seem big enough to have an impact on engagement, but small enough for a one-man-team (me) to build a bootstrapped solution around They‚Äôre a great fit for building something within an existing, growing communication platform that enables add-ons, such as Slack, Teams, Zoom, etc. This means there‚Äôs an existing distribution channel, and higher chances of people discovering my solution There‚Äôs some connection to mental health, and I hope to flesh it out ‚û°Ô∏è Next steps: Validation Validation is a smart-sounding word, but it can mean different things for different people at different stages of a company. For me, this will be about making the below problem more concrete.\nIn a distributed work environment, growing and maintaining employee experience \u0026 engagement requires tools that most managers are not equipped with, and structure that most teams can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt build on their own.\nThe questions that I hope to answer:\n‚ùìDoes the problem really exist?\n‚ùìWhat are the root causes?\n‚ùìWhat is really hard or painful about it?\n‚ùìHow are people solving it?\n‚ùìWhat works and doesn‚Äôt work with existing solutions?\nThis will mean that I‚Äôll be working on a few things in parallel:\nFind potential customers and talk to them, starting with people managers and HR professionals in my network Build an MVP. TBD how functional it‚Äôs going to be (could be some mockups, a landing page, an actual add-on with basic functionality). The idea is to have something people can react to Understand existing solutions, and what could be a unique angle of attack üôèThank you for reading! Your feedback is always very helpfulüíú !
