      <description>My main goal for 2024 was to reach ramen profitability with TypeCharm. The odds are against me. Most startups fail in the 1st 2 years. Time to revenue can (did!) stretch beyond the initial rush of optimism and willpower.
How to trick my brain to put in the effort for its own sake, suspending judgement? What could I do that pushed my performance to the limit, with more certainty for a pay off?</description>

      <description>In December last year, I had finished a proof concept for a chrome extension that determines people‚Äôs DISC personality type based on people‚Äôs LinkedIn profiles. The plan was to spend the following two months (January and February) on user discovery - understanding what my potential customers really need. In this post I‚Äôll talk about how that went, what progress I made since then, and what‚Äôs next.

      <description>Hi and welcome to another post on my entrepreneurship journey. This is the last post for 2023, so let‚Äôs get right to it.
üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏èOctober In my previous post, I mentioned how I was still talking to someone from my last founding team about building something together. That didn‚Äôt work out - hard to find a common topic. I had a few other co-founder dates but none that grew into something more.</description>

      <description>Hi and welcome to my wantrepreneurship blog!
The past two months have been yet another roller coaster that ended in‚Ä¶ well it didn‚Äôt end the way I hoped. I wish the title of this blog was ‚ÄúFirst customers using the app - learnings‚Äù, but today‚Äôs post is more of a post-mortem. In fact, it‚Äôs two post mortems in one.
However, that‚Äôs not a bad thing (well not completely). In 2023 alone, I can count 5 projects and/or teams that I‚Äôve started and stopped, so far.</description>

      <description>Hi there! Thanks for coming to my blog where I write about my entrepreneurial journey!
On Monday, I started the Antler program together with around 60 other founders. It‚Äôs amazing to see so many curious, driven people, that all want to build something great, all in one place. I‚Äôm very grateful to share this experience with them.
For the coming months, I‚Äôll be writing about my progress at Antler, where my goal is to find one or two co-founders, explore an idea together, and build it up to a seed-stage company.</description>

ü¶ëUpdates to SquidGPT After talking to around 10 product managers, I prioritized the first few frameworks that fit the following requirements:
Widely used by product managers across companies AI can write content on them from rough inputs My interviewees said they have already used or would use AI to help them write this type of content The frameworks I implemented are:</description>

      <description>Hey there, thanks for coming! This week I started customer development efforts. The goal is to talk to people that could benefit from using SquidGPT, and understand what problems it could help them solve. That should translate into improvements and new features in the app, which will turn it into a product people actually find helpful.
Also, big announcement this week: I got accepted into Antler‚Äôs April Paris cohort.

I was hoping to have a working, installable version of the bot by the end of February.

In my last post, I finished with a list of ways to find micro-Saas ideas, that I planned to use.
One of the ways was trying find inspiration in SaaS idea newsletters. So, for the past week-and-a-bit, I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing that, which produced some moderate results. Here‚Äôs a dump of ideas:
