      <description>Hey there, thanks for coming! This week I started customer development efforts. The goal is to talk to people that could benefit from using SquidGPT, and understand what problems it could help them solve. That should translate into improvements and new features in the app, which will turn it into a product people actually find helpful.
Also, big announcement this week: I got accepted into Antler‚Äôs April Paris cohort.

      <description>Hi and welcome to this week‚Äôs update! This week I was heads down coding the bot installation and user management. I finished that in good time and spent some time iterating implementing first feedback in SquidGPT‚Äôs website + some minor formatting improvements in the actual app. Finally, today I found out OpenAI is working on their own Slack app (‚ö†Ô∏è) - no surprise there, but still .

      <description>Hi and welcome to this week‚Äôs update! It‚Äôs been a month since I‚Äôm working on SquidGPT - a Slack bot that answers business questions according to pre-defined frameworks. I was hoping to have a working, installable version of the bot by the end of February. It looks like I‚Äôll be extending that deadline until next week (for now üòÖ) - turns out user management is more difficult than I thought.</description>

      <description>Hi and welcome to my weekly update! I‚Äôve spent the past 3 weeks working on a Slack bot that answers business questions according to pre-defined frameworks - SlackGPT. A minimum-viable version of SlackGPT is in progress. That includes a working bot that users can install onto their own Slack workspace and interact with from multiple touchpoints + a landing page. My self-imposed deadline (see random thought below) for this version is 28.</description>

      <description>Hi and welcome to my weekly update, where I write about the day-to-day of my attempt at entrepreneurship. Last week I wrote about my vision for the Slack app that I‚Äôm building, and what needs to get done on the way to a working prototype. In this post I share some updates on said prototype.
üõ¥Road to a working prototype This week, I‚Äôve been focused on two things: improving results from GPT and building a running slack app with slash commands and shortcuts.</description>

      <description>Hi and thanks for coming to my blog!
In my last post I wrote about committing to build a Slack app that gives access to the GPT AI language model. This week I‚Äôve thought more about what exactly this app should be doing and also had great progress in building a prototype. In this post, I will be covering:

      <description>Hi and welcome to my weekly post! It‚Äôs been too long since we spoke last time, so why don‚Äôt you schedule a quick call with me here?
In the last post, I talked about my ideas for Slack apps. They were either in the AI space or focused on productivity or integrations. In this post, I cover how I thought about my elimination process and what was left after it.</description>

      <description>I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs been two months (three including breaks) of writing! One of the cool things about writing here is that I go back to what I wrote, to check what I was thinking last week. When a lot of my output is ‚Äúthinking‚Äù, that helps me build on top of what I previously thought.

      <description>Hi and thanks for coming by! Short update this week.
In my last post, I finished with a list of ways to find micro-Saas ideas, that I planned to use.
One of the ways was trying find inspiration in SaaS idea newsletters. So, for the past week-and-a-bit, I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing that, which produced some moderate results. Here‚Äôs a dump of ideas:
Idea dump * Taxfix for solopreneurs * Bubble plugin that takes webform data to google sheets * Linktree-style website builder for doctors and other independent practitioners, including appointment booking, payments, loyalty.</description>

      <description>Hi there, and thanks for reading my blog and for your feedback üíö! It‚Äôs making a huge difference, in that it forces me to make my thinking clearer and it makes this ‚Äújourney‚Äù less lonely.
In my last post, I wrote about deciding to drop the field of employee engagement. As next steps, I proposed to:

      <description>Hi! Welcome to my blog, where I write about my path to building an internet business.
I‚Äôm feeling better after last week‚Äôs cold, and excited about the holiday season: reading books and spending time with friends and family. Also, excited to share with you what I‚Äôve learned this week.
üìëQuick recap Three weeks ago I declared (üò¨) that I will be focusing on the employee engagement space. What I‚Äôve found since then is that this space is super-crowded, with hundreds of companies doing almost the same thing.</description>

      <description>Hi, and welcome to my building-in-public blog. This week‚Äôs update is a short one. I wasted too much time reading articles and too little time documenting research. Also got a cold.
‚û°Ô∏è Last week, I said I‚Äôll be working on: Find potential customers and talk to them, starting with people managers and HR professionals in my network ‚Äî&amp;gt; Will start preparing questions in the coming weeks, but will only reach out once the year ends, as I doubt I‚Äôll get many responses before that.</description>

      <description>Hi, and welcome to my building-in-public blog. The past week hasn‚Äôt been as productive as my inner critic keeps peddling, but I‚Äôve managed to work on all the next steps I set out in my previous post.
Next steps from last week ‚úÖ Find common promising themes across brainstorming notes: expanding on that in the next section
‚úîÔ∏è Write about the top 5 ideas I‚Äôm considering to moving to the next phase (validation) - hard to give myself a full checkmark for this one, as it‚Äôs really only one idea.</description>

      <description>Hi, I‚Äôm Stefan.
If you‚Äôre reading this you probably know me personally, so you know that I‚Äôve had an entrepreneurial itch since the pandemic started. Two and a half years later, I‚Äôve built up enough courage to scratch that itch. I plan to spend the next phase of my life creating a software solution to a yet-to-be-defined problem.
What‚Äôs in this post:
Building in public - why I‚Äôll be sharing my progress step by step Generating startup ideas - how I‚Äôm approaching the first step in building a business üì¢Building in public What is building in public?</description>
