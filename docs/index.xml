      <description>Hi, and welcome to my building-in-public blog. The past week hasn’t been as productive as my inner critic keeps peddling, but I’ve managed to work on all the next steps I set out in my previous post.
Next steps from last week ✅ Find common promising themes across brainstorming notes: expanding on that in the next section
✔️ Write about the top 5 ideas I’m considering to moving to the next phase (validation) - hard to give myself a full checkmark for this one, as it’s really only one idea.</description>

Two and a half years later, I’ve built up enough courage to scratch that itch. I plan to spend the next phase of my life creating a software solution to a yet-to-be-defined problem.
What’s in this post:
Building in public - why I’ll be sharing my progress step by step Generating startup ideas - how I’m approaching the first step in building a business 📢Building in public What is building in public?</description>
