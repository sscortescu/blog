      <description>Hi and welcome to my weekly post! It’s been too long since we spoke last time, so why don’t you schedule a quick call with me here?
In the last post, I talked about my ideas for Slack apps. They were either in the AI space or focused on productivity or integrations. In this post, I cover how I thought about my elimination process and what was left after it.</description>

      <description>I can’t believe it’s been two months (three including breaks) of writing! One of the cool things about writing here is that I go back to what I wrote, to check what I was thinking last week. When a lot of my output is “thinking”, that helps me build on top of what I previously thought.

      <description>Hi and thanks for coming by! Short update this week.
In my last post, I finished with a list of ways to find micro-Saas ideas, that I planned to use.
One of the ways was trying find inspiration in SaaS idea newsletters. So, for the past week-and-a-bit, I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing that, which produced some moderate results. Here’s a dump of ideas:
Idea dump * Taxfix for solopreneurs * Bubble plugin that takes webform data to google sheets * Linktree-style website builder for doctors and other independent practitioners, including appointment booking, payments, loyalty.</description>

      <description>Hi there, and thanks for reading my blog and for your feedback 💚! It’s making a huge difference, in that it forces me to make my thinking clearer and it makes this “journey” less lonely.
In my last post, I wrote about deciding to drop the field of employee engagement. As next steps, I proposed to:
Write up my checklist for an idea worth exploring Try more ways to find micro-saas ideas.</description>

      <description>Hey there! This is my last post for 2022, and I’ll be back to the regular updates in 3 weeks. Thanks for reading my writing so far, for sharing your feedback and encouragement, and for keeping me accountable!
⬅️Last week, I set out to: ❌Prepare for customer interviews
✅Try to decide whether going into a super crowded space is worth it
✅[Maybe] Try to see how far I can get in building out one of the ideas above</description>

      <description>Hi! Welcome to my blog, where I write about my path to building an internet business.
I’m feeling better after last week’s cold, and excited about the holiday season: reading books and spending time with friends and family. Also, excited to share with you what I’ve learned this week.
📑Quick recap Three weeks ago I declared (😬) that I will be focusing on the employee engagement space. What I’ve found since then is that this space is super-crowded, with hundreds of companies doing almost the same thing.</description>

      <description>Hi, and welcome to my building-in-public blog. This week’s update is a short one. I wasted too much time reading articles and too little time documenting research. Also got a cold.
➡️ Last week, I said I’ll be working on: Find potential customers and talk to them, starting with people managers and HR professionals in my network —&amp;gt; Will start preparing questions in the coming weeks, but will only reach out once the year ends, as I doubt I’ll get many responses before that.</description>

      <description>Hi, and welcome to my building-in-public blog. The past week hasn’t been as productive as my inner critic keeps peddling, but I’ve managed to work on all the next steps I set out in my previous post.
Next steps from last week ✅ Find common promising themes across brainstorming notes: expanding on that in the next section
✔️ Write about the top 5 ideas I’m considering to moving to the next phase (validation) - hard to give myself a full checkmark for this one, as it’s really only one idea.</description>

      <description>Hi, I’m Stefan.
If you’re reading this you probably know me personally, so you know that I’ve had an entrepreneurial itch since the pandemic started. Two and a half years later, I’ve built up enough courage to scratch that itch. I plan to spend the next phase of my life creating a software solution to a yet-to-be-defined problem.
What’s in this post:
Building in public - why I’ll be sharing my progress step by step Generating startup ideas - how I’m approaching the first step in building a business 📢Building in public What is building in public?</description>
