      <description>Hi, and welcome to my building-in-public blog. This week‚Äôs update is a short one. I wasted too much time reading articles and too little time documenting research. Also got a cold.
‚û°Ô∏è Last week, I said I‚Äôll be working on: Find potential customers and talk to them, starting with people managers and HR professionals in my network ‚Äî&amp;gt; Will start preparing questions in the coming weeks, but will only reach out once the year ends, as I doubt I‚Äôll get many responses before that.</description>

      <description>Hi, and welcome to my building-in-public blog. The past week hasn‚Äôt been as productive as my inner critic keeps peddling, but I‚Äôve managed to work on all the next steps I set out in my previous post.
Next steps from last week ‚úÖ Find common promising themes across brainstorming notes: expanding on that in the next section
‚úîÔ∏è Write about the top 5 ideas I‚Äôm considering to moving to the next phase (validation) - hard to give myself a full checkmark for this one, as it‚Äôs really only one idea.</description>

      <description>Hi, I‚Äôm Stefan.
If you‚Äôre reading this you probably know me personally, so you know that I‚Äôve had an entrepreneurial itch since the pandemic started. Two and a half years later, I‚Äôve built up enough courage to scratch that itch. I plan to spend the next phase of my life creating a software solution to a yet-to-be-defined problem.
What‚Äôs in this post:
Building in public - why I‚Äôll be sharing my progress step by step Generating startup ideas - how I‚Äôm approaching the first step in building a business üì¢Building in public What is building in public?</description>
